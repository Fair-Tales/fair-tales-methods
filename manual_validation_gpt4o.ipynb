With a\\ngulp and a burp Danny’s\\nfather was gone.\\nNow nothing was left - all Danny\\ncould see Was a fat dinosaur where\\nhis home used to be.\\nAnd so, with the thought of no\\nChristmas this year, His tears\\nturned to snowflakes and then\\ndisappeared.\\nWith the feeling of guilt in the dinosaur\\'s gut,\\nIts brain brewed a plan\\ninvolving its butt.\\nIt knew there was only one thing it could do:\\nTo put Christmas right it needed to ...\\n\\nPOO!\\n\\nIt pooped out the turkey, the toys and the telly,\\nAnd even the tinsel was now brown and smelly.\\nIt pooped all the presents and pieces of puzzles,\\nIt pooped all the things it had previously guzzled.\\nAnd then Father Christmas yelled “OUT OF THE WAY!\\nAs he flew from the dinosaur\\'s bum on his sleigh.\\nThe dinosaur finally gave a huge push\\nAnd pooped Danny\\'s parents in one massive\\nWhooooooosh!\\nLast, but not least, and never forgotten, Granny\\nplopped out of the dinosaur\\'s bottom.\\n“Merry Christmas,’ said Dan to his whole family\\nAs they washed off the presents and put up the tree. And\\nthe greedy young chap that you saw just before\\nPromised next Christmas he\\'d not ask for more.\\nAnd the dinosaur\\npromised he’d not eat a\\ncrumb ...\\n. . as you would if Christmas came out of your bumf'"
