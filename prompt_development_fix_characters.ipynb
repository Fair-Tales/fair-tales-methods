    "### Task decomposition and prompt development.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide here a framework for developing sequential prompts for a complex NLP task using GPT4o.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complex tasks is decompsed into as sequence of simpler tasks that each build on the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each task in the sequence we produce a number of examples to show GPT4o, and a number of further examples to use for automated testing of the response. This borrows ideas from unit testing of software, since iterative changes to the prompt may break functionality that was previously working.\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework can be adapted to use with other LLMs and NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We decompose into the following tasks:\n",
    "- Task 1: identify sections of direct speech, and the name of the speaker and recipient\n",
    "- Task 2: locate pre-defined sentences in these detected sections of speech (for comparison with human coding)\n",
    "- Task 3: pull out the spoken words only from each section (removing e.g. 'he said' etc)\n",
    "- Task 4: locate and replace the names of the speakers and recipients using a pre-defined character map  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes:\n",
    "- Determinism is not guaranteed. But well structured prompts should produce near deterministic outputs, along with temperature=0, fixed seed. It is also worth storing the system finerprint for future reference, as changes to this may be the cause of differing results in the future.  \n",
    "- The lack of determinism can make tests quite brittle. It is worth repeating tests several times to confirm their behvaiour. And then running the full manual validation on a single static result set.\n",
    "- Where possible, the sequential tasks should b tackled as a new completion API, using formatted output from the previous task as the inupt. This is preferrable to chaining of prompts and outputs to produce a chat style conversation, but this increases the risk of conflict or confusion between prompts/instructions sets. And also increases the length of the context window.\n",
    "- Need to ensure consistency between instructions, schemas and examples. Otherwise results may be inconsistent e.g. 'reproduce all punctuation all it appears' conflicted with 'remove  speech marks' example.\n",
    "- Should typos be accounted for (e.g. task_3 name matching?)\n",
    "- Cost: \\\\$1.22 left after developing prompts. Added \\\\$10 to run for 50 books (so ~0.25 full dataset). "

    " - When in pipeline to spellcheck/ correct typos? (e.g. Hany in the Dinosaurs (book 21).\n",
    " - what to do about inconsitent sentence detection? e.g \"Now Dasher!\" being at the end of sentence 7 was causing GPT confusion...\n",
    " - add an instruction about how to refer to 'general audience' or 'narrator' or 'I'\n",
    " - provide example of input and what the output should look like (within the prompt)\n",
    " - should temp be close to 0 (but not exactly 0)?\n",
    " - ask for output of reaosning/thought process?\n",
    " - ask for a confidence score?\n",

      "“Do you know what I wo uld like for my lunch today?” the\n",
      "Enormous Crocodile asked.\n",
      "\"No,” the Notsobig One said. “What?”\n",
      "The Enormous Crocodile grinned, showing hundreds of sharp white\n",
      "teeth. “ For my lunch today,” he said, “I would like a nice juicy little\n",
      "child.”\n",
      "“I never eat children,” the Notsobig One said. \"Only fish.”\n",
      "“Ho, ho, ho!” cried the Enormous Crocodile. \"I’ll bet if you saw a\n",
      "fat juicy little child paddling in the water ov er there at this very\n",
      "moment, you’d gulp him up in one gollop!”\n",
      "“No, I wouldn’t,” the Notsobig One said. “Children are to o tough\n",
      "and chewy. They are tough and chewy and nasty and bitter.”\n",
      "” Tough and chewy!” cried the Enormous Crocodile. “Nasty and\n",
      "bitter! What awful tommy-rot you talk! They are juicy and yummy!”\n",
      "“They taste so bitter,” the Notsobig One said, “you have to cover\n",
      "them with sugar before you can eat them.”\n",
      "\"Children are bigg er than fish,” said the Enormous Crocodile. \"You\n",
      "get bigger helpings.”\n",
      "\"You are greedy,” the Notsobig One said. \"You’re the greediest\n",

      "\"You’ve only done that once,” snorted the Notsobig One. \"A nd\n",
      "what happened then? They all saw you coming and ran away.”\n",
      "\"Ah, but today wh en I go, they won’t see me at all,” said the\n",
      "Enormous Crocodile.\n",
      "\"Of course they’ll see you,” the Notsobig One said. \"You’re so\n",

      "The Enormous Crocodile grinned again, and his terrible sharp\n",
      "teeth sparkled like knives in the sun. \"Nobody will see me,” he sa id,\n",
      "\"because this time I’ve thought up secret plans and clever tricks.”\n",
      "\"Clever tricks?’ cried the Notsobig One. \"You’ve never done\n",

      "Goodbye.”\n",
      "The Enormous Crocod ile swam to the side of the river, and\n",
      "crawled out of the water.\n",
      "A gigantic creature was standing in the slimy oozy m ud on the\n",
      "river-bank. It was Humpy-Rumpy, the Hippopotamus.\n",
      "\"Hello, hello,” said H umpy-Rumpy. \"Where on earth are you off\n",
      "to at this time of day?”\n",
      "\"I have secret plans and clever tricks,” said the Crocodile.\n",
      "\"Oh dear,” said H umpy-Rumpy. \"I’ll bet you’re going to do\n",
      "something horrid.”\n",
      "The Enormous Crocodile grinned at Humpy-Rumpy and said:\n",

      "With something yummy yummy yummy yummy!”\n",
      "\"What’s so yummy?” asked Humpy-Rumpy.\n",
      "\"Try to guess,” said the Crocodile. \"It’s something that walks on\n",
      "two legs.”\n",
      "\"You don’t mean ...” said Hum py-Rumpy. \"You don’t really mean\n",
      "you’re going to eat a little child?”\n",
      "\"Of course I am,” said the Crocodile.\n",
      "\"Oh, you horrid greedy grumptious brute!” cried Humpy- Rumpy .\n",
      "\"I hope you get caught and cooked and turned into crocodile soup!”\n",
      "The Enormous Crocodile laughed out loud at Humpy-Rumpy.\n",
      "Then he waddled off into the jungle.\n",
      "Inside the jungle, he met Trunky, the Elephant. Trunky was nibbling\n",
      "leaves from the top of a tall tree, and he d idn’t notice the Crocodile at\n",
      "first. So the Crocodile bit him on the leg.\n",
      "\"Ow!” said Trunky in his big deep voice. \"Who did that?\n",
      "Oh, it’s you, is it, you beastly Crocodile. W hy don’t you go back to the\n",
      "big brown muddy river where you belong?”\n",
      "\"I have secret plans and clever tricks,” said the Crocodile.\n",
      "\"You mean you’ve nasty plans and nasty tricks,” said Trunky.\n",
      "\"You’ve never done a nice thing in your life.”\n",
      "The Enormous Crocodile grinned up at Trunky and said:\n",
      "'I’m off to find a yummy child for lunch.\n",
      "Keep listening and you’ll hear the bones go crunch!”\n",
      "\"Oh, you wicked beastly beast!” cried Trunky. \"Oh, you foul and\n",
      "filthy fiend! I hope you get squ ashed and squished and squizzled and\n",
      "boiled up into crocodile stew!”\n",
      "The Enorm ous Crocodile laughed out loud and disappeared into the\n",
      "thick jungle.\n",
      "A bit further on, he met Mugg le-Wump, the Monkey. Muggle- Wump\n",
      "was sitting in a tree, eating nuts.\n",
      "\"Hello, Crocky,” said Muggle-Wump. \"What are you up to now?”\n",
      "\"I have secret plans and clever tricks,” said the Croco dile.\n",
      "\"Would you like some nuts?” asked Muggle-Wump.\n",
      "\"I have better things to eat than nuts,” sniffed the Crocodile.\n",
      "\"I did n’t think there was anything better than nuts,” said Muggle-\n",
      "Wump.\n",
      "\"Ah-ha,” said the Enormous Crocodile,\n",
      "\"The sort of things that I’m going to eat\n",
      "Have fingers, toe-nails, arms and legs and feet!”\n",
      "Muggle-Wump went pale and began to shake all over. \"You aren’t\n",
      "really going to gobble up a little child, are you?” he said.\n",
      "\"Of course I am,” said th e Crocodile. \"Clothes and all. They taste\n",
      "better with the clothes on.”\n",
      "\"Oh, you horrid hoggish croc!” cried Muggle-Wump. \"You slimy\n",
      "creature! I hope the b uttons and buckles all stick in your throat and\n",
      "choke you to death!”\n",
      "The Crocodile grinned up at Muggle-Wump and said, \"I eat\n",
      "monkeys, too.” And quick as a flash, with one bite of his huge\n",
      "jaws, he bit through the tree that Muggle-Wump was sitting in,\n",
      "and down it came. But just in time, Muggle-Wump j umped into\n",
      "the next tree and swung away through the branches.\n",
      "A bit further on, the Enormous Crocodile met the Roly- Poly Bird.\n",
      "The Roly-Poly Bird was building a nest in an orange tree.\n",
      "\"Hello there, Enormous Crocodile!” sang the Roly-Poly Bird.\n",
      "\"We don’t often see you up here in the jungle.”\n",
      "\"Ah,” said the Crocodile. \"I have secret plans and clev er tricks. \"I\n",
      "hope it’s not something nasty,” sang the Roly-Poly Bird .\n",
      "\"Nasty!” cri ed the Crocodile. \"Of course it’s not nasty!\n",
      "It’s delicious!”\n",
      "\"It’s luscious, it’s super,\n",
      "It’s mushious, it’s duper, It’s\n",
      "better than rotten old fish. You\n",
      "mash it and mun ch it, You chew\n",
      "it and crunch it!\n",
      "It’s lovely to hear it go squish!”\n",
      "\"It must be berries,” sang the Roly-Poly Bird. \"Berr ies are my\n",
      "favourite food in the world. I s it raspberries, perhaps?\n",
      "Or could it be strawberries?”\n",
      "The Enormous Crocodile laughed so much his teeth\n",
      "rattled together like pennies in a moneybox. \"Crocodiles don’t eat\n",
      "berries,” he said. \"We eat little boys and girls. And sometimes we eat\n",
      "Roly-Poly Birds, as well.” Very quickly, the Crocodile reached up\n",
      "and snapped his jaws at the Roly-Poly Bird. He just missed the Bird,\n",
      "but he managed to catch hold of the long beautiful feathers in its tail.\n",
      "The Roly-Poly Bird gave a shriek of terror and shot straight up into\n",
      "the air, leaving its tail feathers behind in the Enormous Crocodile’s\n",
      "mouth.\n",
      "At last, the Enormous Crocodile came out of the other side of the\n",
      "jungle into the sunshine. He could see the town not far away.\n",
      "\"Ho-ho!” he said, talking aloud to himself. \"Ha-ha! That walk\n",
      "through the jungle has made me hungrier than ever. One child isn’t\n",
      "going to be nearly enough for me today. I won’t be full up until I’ve\n",
      "eaten at least three juicy little children!”\n",
      "He started to creep forward towards the town.\n",
      "The Enormous Cr ocodile crept over to a place where there were a\n",
      "lot of coconut trees.\n",
      "He knew that children from the town often came here looking for\n",
      "coconuts. The trees were too tall for them to climb, but the re were\n",
      "always some coconuts on the ground that had fallen down.\n",
      "The Enormous Crocodile quickly collected all the coconuts that\n",
      "were lying on the ground. He also gathered together several fallen\n",
      "branches.\n",
      "“Now for Clever Trick Number One!” he whispered to him self. \"It\n",
      "won’t be long before I am eating the first part of my lunch!”\n",
      "He took all the coconut branches and held them between his teeth.\n",
      "He grasped the coconuts in his front paw s. Then he stood straight\n",
      "up in the air, balancing himself on his tail.\n",
      "He arranged the branches and the coconuts so cleverly that he now\n",
      "looked exactly like a small coconut tree standing among the big\n",
      "coconut trees.\n",
      "Soon, two children came along. They were brother and sister. The boy was\n",
      "called Toto. His sister was called Mary. They walked around looking for fallen\n",
      "coconuts, but they co uldn’t find any because the Enormous Crocodile had\n",
      "gathered them all up.\n",
      "\"Oh look!” cried Toto. \"That tree over there is much smaller than the others!\n",
      "And it’s full of coco nuts! I think I could climb that one quite easily if you help\n",
      "me up the first bit.”\n",
      "Toto and Mary ran towards what they thought was the small coconut tree.\n",
      "The Enormous Crocodile peered through the branches, watching them as they\n",
      "came closer and closer. He licked his lips. He began to dribble with excitement.\n",
      "& -\n",
      "Suddenly there was a tremendous whooshing noise. It was\n",
      "Humpy-Rumpy, the Hippopotamus. He came crashing and snorting\n",
      "out of the jung le. His head was down low and he was galloping at a\n",
      "terrific speed.\n",
      "\"Look out, Toto!” shouted Humpy-Rumpy. \"Look out, Mary!\n",
      "That’s not a co conut tree! It’s the Enormous Crocodile and he wants\n",
      "to eat you up!”\n",
      "Humpy-Rumpy charged straight at the Enormous Crocodile. He\n",
      "caught him with his giant head and sent him tumbling and skidding\n",
      "over the ground.\n",
      "\"Ow-eeee!” cried the Crocodile. \"Help! Stop! Where am I?”\n",
      "Toto and Mary ran back to the town as fast as they could.\n",
      "But croc odiles are tough. It is difficult for even a Hippopotamus to\n",
      "hurt them.\n",
      "The Enormous Crocodile picked himself up and crept towards the\n",
      "place where the children’s playground was.\n",
      "\"Now for Clever Trick Num ber Two!” he said to himself.\n",
      "\"This one is certain to work!”\n",
      "There were no c hildren in the playground at that moment. They\n",
      "were all in school.\n",
      "The Enormous Crocodile found a large piece of wood and placed\n",
      "it in the middle of the playground. Then he lay across the piece of\n",
      "wood an d tucked in his feet so that he looked almost exactly like a\n",
      "see-saw.\n",
      "When sch ool was over, the children all came running on to the\n",
      "playground.\n",
      "\"Oh look!” they cried. '’We’ve got a new see-saw!”\n",
      "They all crowded round, sh outing with excitement.\n",
      "\"Bags I have the first go!”\n",
      "\"I’ll get on the other end!”\n",
      "\"I want to go first!”\n",
      "\"So do I! So do I!”\n",
      "Then, a girl who was older than the others said, \"It’s rather a\n",
      "funny knob bly sort of a see-saw, isn’t it? Do you think it’ll be safe\n",
      "to sit on?”\n",
      "\"Of course it will!” the others said. \"It looks strong as anything!”\n",
      "The Enormous Crocodile opened one eye just a tiny bit and\n",
      "watched the children who were crowding around him. Soon, he\n",
      "thought, one of them is going to sit on my head, then I will give a\n",
      "jerk and a snap, and after that it will be yum yum yum.\n",
      "At that moment, there was a flash of brown and som ething jumped into the\n",
      "playground and hopped up on to the to p of the swings.\n",
      "It was Muggle-Wump, the Monkey.\n",
      "\"Run!” Muggle-Wump shouted to the children. \"All of you, run, run, run!\n",
      "That’s not a see-saw! It’s the Enormous Crocod ile and he wants to eat you up!”\n",
      "The children screamed and ran for their lives.\n",
      "Muggle-Wump disappeared back into the ju ngle, and the Enormous\n",
      "Crocodile was left all alone in the playground.\n",
      "\n",
      "He cursed the Monkey and waddled back into the bushes to hide.\n",
      "\"I’m getting hungrier a nd hungrier!” he said. \"I shall have to eat at least four children\n",
      "now before I am full up!”\n",
      "The E normous Crocodile crept around the edge of the town, taking great care not to\n",
      "be seen.\n",
      "He came to a place where they were getting ready to have a fair. There were slides\n",
      "and swings and do dgem-cars and people selling popcorn and candy-floss. There was also\n",
      "a big roundabout.\n",
      "The roundabout had marvellous wooden creatures for the children to ride on. There\n",
      "were white horses and lions and tigers and mermaids w ith fishes’ tails and fearsome\n",
      "dragons with red tongues sticking out of their mouths.\n",
      "\"Now for Clever Trick Number Three,” said the Enormous Crocodile, licking his lips.\n",
      "When no one was looking, he crept up on to the roundabout and put himself between\n",
      "a wooden lion and a fearsome dragon. He sat up a bit on his back le gs and he kept very\n",
      "still. He looked exactly like a wooden crocodile on the roundabout.\n",
      "Soon, all sorts of children came flo cking into the fair. Several of them ran towards the\n",
      "roundabout. They were very excited.\n",
      "\"I’m going to ride on a dragon!” cried one.\n",
      "\"I’m going on a lovely white horse!” cri ed another.\n",
      "\"I’m going on a lion!” cried a third one.\n",
      "And one little girl, whose name wa s Jill said, \"I’m going to ride\n",
      "on that funny old wooden crocodile!”\n",
      "The Enormous Crocodile kept very still, but he could see the little\n",
      "girl coming towards him. \"Y ummy-yum-yum,” he thought. \"I’ll gulp\n",
      "her up easily in one gollop.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly there was a swish and a swoosh and something came swishing\n",
      "and swooshing out of the sky .\n",
      "It was the Roly-Poly Bird.\n",
      "He flew round and round the roundabout, singing, \"L ook out,\n",
      "Jill! Look out! Look out! Don ’t ride on that crocodile!”\n",
      "Jill stopped and looked up.\n",
      "\"That’s not a wooden crocodile!” sang the Roly-Poly Bird. \"It’s a real\n",
      "one! It’s the Enormous Crocodile from the river and he wants to eat you up!”\n",
      "Jill turned and ran. So did all the other children. Even the man who w as\n",
      "working the roundabout jumped off it and ran away as fast as he could.\n",
      "The Enormous Croc odile cursed the Roly-Poly Bird and waddled back\n",

      "Just outside the town, there was a pretty little field with trees and\n",

      "From the sa me table, he took away one of the benches and hid it\n",
      "in the bushes.\n",
      "Then he put himself in the place where the bench had been.\n",
      "By tucking his head under his chest, and by twisting his tail out of\n",
