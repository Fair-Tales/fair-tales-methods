    "### Task decomposition and prompt development.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide here a framework for developing sequential prompts for a complex NLP task using GPT4o.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complex tasks is decompsed into as sequence of simpler tasks that each build on the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each task in the sequence we produce a number of examples to show GPT4o, and a number of further examples to use for automated testing of the response. This borrows ideas from unit testing of software, since iterative changes to the prompt may break functionality that was previously working.\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework can be adapted to use with other LLMs and NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We decompose into the following tasks:\n",
    "- Task 1: identify sections of direct speech, and the name of the speaker and recipient\n",
    "- Task 1b: locate pre-defined sentences in these detected sections of speech (for comparison with human coding)\n",
    "- Task 2: pull out the spoken words only from each section (removing e.g. 'he said' etc)\n",
    "- Task 3: locate and replace the names of the speakers and recipients using a pre-defined character map  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes:\n",
    "- Determinism is not guaranteed. But well structured prompts should produce near deterministic outputs, along with temperature=0, fixed seed. It is also worth storing the system finerprint for future reference, as changes to this may be the cause of differing results in the future.  \n",
    "- The lack of determinism can make tests quite brittle. It is worth repeating tests several times to confirm their behvaiour. And then running the full manual validation on a single static result set.\n",
    "- Where possible, the sequential tasks should b tackled as a new completion API, using formatted output from the previous task as the inupt. This is preferrable to chaining of prompts and outputs to produce a chat style conversation, but this increases the risk of conflict or confusion between prompts/instructions sets. And also increases the length of the context window.\n",
    "- Need to ensure consistency between instructions, schemas and examples. Otherwise results may be inconsistent e.g. 'reproduce all punctuation all it appears' conflicted with 'remove  speech marks' example.\n",
    "- Should typos be accounted for (e.g. task_3 name matching?)\n",
    "- Cost: \\\\$1.22 left after developing prompts. Added \\\\$10 to run for 50 books (so ~0.25 full dataset). "

    "- Refactor run_task and run_test methods and move them to separate files\n",
    "- Use SpaCy doc/spans to hanlde speech sections, which knowledge base of characters and aliases, and tags for who is speaking etc.\n",
    "- Then can use the spans to handle splitting books with some overlap to avoid splitting speech/conversations resulting in 'unknown' speaker/recipient. \n",
    "- Add further analysis of speech sections: what is being said - commands, questions, statements, sentiment, who is being spoken about etc.\n",
    "- Better handling of cases where the speech section get split in later tasks (or ideally prevent this from happening).\n",
