358	Barry The Fish With Fingers	9	Puffy the puffer fish, could blow the BEST bubbles.	0
359	Barry The Fish With Fingers	12	Other fish would come from miles around to see his bubble-blowing show.	1
360	Barry The Fish With Fingers	18	Big bubbles, small bubbles, round bubbles, square bubbles - they had never seen anything quite so amazing until...	2
361	Barry The Fish With Fingers	10	They caught sight of Barry Barry was no ordinary fish.	3
362	Barry The Fish With Fingers	6	Barry was a fish with fingers!	4
363	Barry The Fish With Fingers	13	Suddenly, everyone wanted to find out more about the amazing fish with fingers.	5
364	Barry The Fish With Fingers	8	"""What can your fingers do, Barry?” they asked."	6
365	Barry The Fish With Fingers	9	"""Tell us, tell usl” “Well,” said Barry “Fingers mean.."	7
366	Barry The Fish With Fingers	6	"""Fingerpainting, knitting, cutting and... FINGER PUPPETS!"	8
367	Barry The Fish With Fingers	7	But, best of all, fingers mean… Tickling!	9
368	Barry The Fish With Fingers	8	The fish had never had so much fun.	10
369	Barry The Fish With Fingers	3	“Come on, Puffy.	11
370	Barry The Fish With Fingers	4	Join in!” said Barry	12
371	Barry The Fish With Fingers	7	But Puffy didn’t want to join in.	13
372	Barry The Fish With Fingers	4	He was feeling sad.	14
373	Barry The Fish With Fingers	10	“Now nobody wants to see my bubble-blowing show,” he sighed.	15
374	Barry The Fish With Fingers	4	"""I hate Barry’s fingers."	16
375	Barry The Fish With Fingers	2	They're stupid!”	17
376	Barry The Fish With Fingers	33	So while Puffy sulked on his own, Barry and the other fish had a whale of a time, chasing each other through sea caves, in and out of seashells and through the seaweed.	18
377	Barry The Fish With Fingers	11	But, all of a sudden, Barry stopped dead in his tracks.	19
378	Barry The Fish With Fingers	9	He heard a loud splash and a rumbling noise.	20
379	Barry The Fish With Fingers	12	Then the sea got darker and a big shadow covered the ocean.	21
380	Barry The Fish With Fingers	4	Oil, no! cried Barry	22
381	Barry The Fish With Fingers	5	Oh, no! cried the fish.	23
382	Barry The Fish With Fingers	15	A huge crate had fallen into the water and it was going to squash Puffy.	24
383	Barry The Fish With Fingers	7	"“Quick, Barry, do something!"" cried the fish."	25
384	Barry The Fish With Fingers	12	And that was when Barry did something truly amazing - he pointed!	26
385	Barry The Fish With Fingers	3	“Look out, Puffy!”	27
386	Barry The Fish With Fingers	10	With a loud Crash the crate hit the sea bed.	28
387	Barry The Fish With Fingers	4	Was it too late?	29
388	Barry The Fish With Fingers	5	Had poor Puffy been squashed?	30
389	Barry The Fish With Fingers	1	Phew!	31
390	Barry The Fish With Fingers	3	No, he hadn’t.	32
391	Barry The Fish With Fingers	16	“Thank you, Barry,” said Puffy “You saved my life I’m sorry for being a grumpy spoilsport.	33
392	Barry The Fish With Fingers	5	Can we play tickle chase?”	34
393	Barry The Fish With Fingers	9	But Barry had a better idea... “LET'S P !”	35
394	Barry The Fish With Fingers	5	ARTY “Take it away, Puffy!”	36
395	Barry The Fish With Fingers	2	he cried.	37
396	Barry The Fish With Fingers	16	So Barry played the piano, Puffy blew the trumpet and everyone had the BEST time ever	38
397	The Troll	10	There was once a troll who lived under a bridge.	0
398	The Troll	7	(That’s where trolls are supposed to live.)	1
399	The Troll	14	Meanwhile, far out at sea, there were some pirates who lived in a ship.	2
400	The Troll	7	(That’s where pirates are supposed to live.)	3
401	The Troll	17	Trolls are supposed to eat goats, but no goats ever came trip-trapping over this troll’s little bridge.	4
402	The Troll	5	So he ate fish instead.	5
403	The Troll	11	But one morning he heard a faint noise on his bridge.	6
404	The Troll	17	Up he popped, and he said what trolls are supposed to say, which is... over my bridge?”	7
405	The Troll	13	“Who’s that trip-trapping “I’m not trip-trapping, I’m scuttling,” said a tiny black creature.	8
406	The Troll	4	“And I’m a spider.”	9
407	The Troll	11	“Oh bother, I thought you were a goat,” said the troll.	10
408	The Troll	8	“No - goats have fur,” said the spider.	11
409	The Troll	9	“Never mind, I’ll eat you anyway,” said the troll.	12
410	The Troll	7	"""You’ll make a nice change from fish.”"	13
411	The Troll	8	“Oh please don’t eat me!” said the spider.	14
412	The Troll	12	“Why don’t you go further down the river to the next bridge?	15
413	The Troll	7	It’s a much better bridge for goats.”	16
414	The Troll	6	“All right then,” said the troll.	17
415	The Troll	15	So he packed up his frying pan and his cookery book, and off he strode.	18
416	The Troll	19	Pirates are supposed to dig for treasure, and these pirates had a treasure map with a rhyme on it.	19
417	The Troll	14	Between the palm tree and the rocks, six foot deep lies a treasure box.	20
418	The Troll	10	They sailed and they sailed until they reached an island.	21
419	The Troll	7	“This is the spot,” said Hank Chief.	22
420	The Troll	2	“Start digging!”	23
421	The Troll	15	The pirates dug and they dug, but all that they found was a grumpy mole.	24
422	The Troll	8	“It must be the wrong island,” they said.	25
423	The Troll	7	All that digging had made them hungry.	26
424	The Troll	9	It was Ben Buckle’s turn to do the cooking.	27
425	The Troll	4	He cooked fish pie.	28
426	The Troll	6	“It’s soggy ,” said Percy Patch.	29
427	The Troll	5	“It’s slimy,” said Peg Polkadot.	30
428	The Troll	15	“When we find the gold we can buy a decent cookery book,” said Hank Chief.	31
429	The Troll	5	And they set sail again.	32
430	The Troll	13	The troll was sitting under his new, middling-sized bridge, reading his cookery book.	33
431	The Troll	8	Suddenly he heard a sound above his head.	34
432	The Troll	3	Up he popped.	35
433	The Troll	8	“Who’s that trip-trapping over my bridge?” he roared.	36
434	The Troll	9	“I’m not trip-trapping, I’m pattering,” said a furry creature.	37
435	The Troll	4	“And I’m a mouse.”	38
436	The Troll	11	“Oh bother, I thought you were a goat,’’ said the troll.	39
437	The Troll	9	“No - goats have longer ears,” said the mouse.	40
438	The Troll	9	“Never mind, I’ll eat you anyway,” said the troll.	41
439	The Troll	5	"""I’m getting sick of fish.”"	42
440	The Troll	8	“Oh please don’t eat me,” said the mouse.	43
441	The Troll	9	“Why don’t you go down to the next bridge?	44
442	The Troll	10	There are goats trip-trapping over that one all the time.	45
443	The Troll	16	“Very well,” said the troll, and he packed up his things again and off he strode.	46
444	The Troll	7	Meanwhile the pirates had discovered another island.	47
445	The Troll	20	They dug and they dug, but all that they found was a rusty old bucket with a crab in it.	48
446	The Troll	7	“It’s the wrong island again,” they said.	49
447	The Troll	7	That night Percy Patch did the cooking.	50
448	The Troll	4	He cooked fish soup.	51
449	The Troll	5	“It’s bony,” said Ben Buckle.	52
450	The Troll	5	“It’s briny,” said Peg Polkadot.	53
451	The Troll	17	“If only we could find the gold, we could pay for a proper cook,” said Hank Chief.	54
452	The Troll	18	The troll was frying fish under his new, big bridge when he heard a sound above his head.	55
453	The Troll	3	Up he popped.	56
454	The Troll	8	“Who’s that trip-trapping over my bridge?” he bellowed.	57
455	The Troll	11	“I’m not trip-trapping, I’m lolloping,” said a creature with long ears.	58
456	The Troll	4	“And I’m a rabbit.”	59
457	The Troll	11	“Oh bother, I thought you were a goat,” said the troll.	60
458	The Troll	8	“No - goats have hoofs,” said the rabbit.	61
459	The Troll	9	“Never mind, I’ll eat you anyway,” said the troll.	62
460	The Troll	4	“Anything’s better than fish.”	63
461	The Troll	8	“Oh please don’t eat me,” said the rabbit.	64
462	The Troll	9	“Why don’t you walk down to the next bridge?	65
463	The Troll	9	There are herds of goats trip-trapping over that one.”	66
464	The Troll	6	“Are you sure?” asked the troll.	67
465	The Troll	9	Once again he packed up, and off he strode.	68
466	The Troll	9	Meanwhile the pirates were digging on a new island.	69
467	The Troll	22	They dug and they dug, but all that they found was an old Wellington boot with a nest of centipedes in it.	70
468	The Troll	8	“We’ll never find the right island,” they said.	71
469	The Troll	11	That night it was Peg Polkadot’s turn to do the cooking.	72
470	The Troll	3	She cooked fishcakes.	73
471	The Troll	5	“They’re sticky,” said Ben Buckle.	74
472	The Troll	5	“They’re sandy,” said Percy Patch.	75
473	The Troll	4	Hank Chief said nothing.	76
474	The Troll	12	He was too busy being sick over the side of the ship.	77
475	The Troll	7	The troll’s river grew wider and wider.	78
476	The Troll	12	Then it stopped being a river and it flowed into the sea.	79
477	The Troll	8	The troll found himself on a sandy beach.	80
478	The Troll	6	“There isn’t another bridge,” he said.	81
479	The Troll	5	“That rabbit was tricking me.”	82
480	The Troll	10	But then he spotted some hoof prints in the sand.	83
481	The Troll	4	“A goat at last!”	84
482	The Troll	2	he cried.	85
483	The Troll	9	He looked around, but he couldn’t see any goats.	86
484	The Troll	11	“Never mind - it will probably come back tomorrow,” he said.	87
485	The Troll	7	The troll followed the hoof prints ...	88
486	The Troll	15	They led him to a spot between a tall palm tree and two big rocks.	89
487	The Troll	2	“I know!”	90
488	The Troll	2	he thought.	91
489	The Troll	4	“I’ll dig a pit.	92
490	The Troll	13	Then tomorrow the goat will fall into it and I can eat it.”	93
491	The Troll	9	The troll dug and dug with his frying pan.	94
492	The Troll	14	Just when he thought the hole was deep enough the pan hit something hard.	95
493	The Troll	6	It was a great big chest.	96
494	The Troll	4	“Perfect,” said the troll.	97
495	The Troll	8	“I can hide in here and keep warm.	98
496	The Troll	15	Then when the goat falls into the hole I’ll open the lid and pop up.”	99
497	The Troll	4	He lifted the lid.	100
498	The Troll	8	The chest was full of round gold things.	101
499	The Troll	16	"""These are no use to me,” he said, and he threw them all into the sea."	102
500	The Troll	9	Then he climbed into the chest and lay down.	103
501	The Troll	10	“Tomorrow I can have goat for breakfast instead of fish!”	104
502	The Troll	8	he thought as he drifted off to sleep.	105
503	The Troll	11	It was dark when the pirates arrived at the next island.	106
504	The Troll	7	“This is the spot,” said Hank Chief.	107
505	The Troll	9	“But someone’s been digging here already!” said Ben Buckle.	108
506	The Troll	11	“Don’t say they’ve found the treasure before us!” said Percy Patch.	109
507	The Troll	2	“No, look!	110
508	The Troll	6	Here it is!” cried Peg Polkadot.	111
509	The Troll	4	The chest was heavy.	112
510	The Troll	9	“It must be full of gold!” said Hank Chief.	113
511	The Troll	1	“Quick!	114
512	The Troll	8	Back to the ship before anyone stops us.”	115
513	The Troll	8	The troll was woken by a loud bang.	116
514	The Troll	7	“That’s my breakfast falling into the hole!”	117
515	The Troll	2	he thought.	118
516	The Troll	8	But why was the chest heaving and swaying?	119
517	The Troll	6	And why was the lid opening?	120
518	The Troll	5	Surely goats can’t open lids?	121
519	The Troll	4	The lid opened wide.	122
520	The Troll	9	Staring down at the troll were four angry pirates.	123
521	The Troll	6	“Where’s the gold?” shouted Hank Chief.	124
522	The Troll	11	“I -I - threw it into the sea,” said the troll.	125
523	The Troll	2	“The plank!	126
524	The Troll	8	The plank!” yelled Ben Buckle and Percy Patch.	127
525	The Troll	5	“Make him walk the plank!”	128
526	The Troll	20	TThhee nneexxtt sseeccoonndd,, tthhee ppiirraatteess wweerree ppuusshhiinngg hhiimm oonn ttoo iitt.. “WHO’S THAT TRIP-TRAPPING OVER MY PLANK?” JEERED HANK CHIEF.	129
527	The Troll	13	“I’m not trip-trapping, I’m shuffling,” said the troll in a very small voice.	130
528	The Troll	4	“And I’m a troll.”	131
529	The Troll	7	He reached the end of the plank.	132
530	The Troll	4	His knees were knocking.	133
531	The Troll	4	“Jump!” yelled the pirates.	134
532	The Troll	8	But just then, Peg Polkadot came running up.	135
533	The Troll	1	“Wait!”	136
534	The Troll	2	she cried.	137
535	The Troll	7	“I’ve found something else inside the chest!”	138
536	The Troll	9	In one hand she held the troll’s frying pan.	139
537	The Troll	9	In the other hand she held his cookery book.	140
538	The Troll	1	“Stop!”	141
539	The Troll	3	called Hank Chief.	142
540	The Troll	9	He looked at the troll in a new way.	143
541	The Troll	5	“Can you cook?” he asked.	144
542	The Troll	9	"""Yes,” said the troll and “YES!” shouted the pirates."	145
543	The Troll	7	“Then you can stay,” said Hank Chief.	146
544	The Troll	12	“Thank you!” said the troll, and he shuffled back along the plank.	147
545	The Troll	4	“When shall I start?”	148
546	The Troll	3	“Now,” said Hank.	149
547	The Troll	8	The pirates showed the troll the ship’s kitchen.	150
548	The Troll	3	The troll grinned.	151
549	The Troll	10	He turned to his favourite page in his cookery book.	152
550	The Troll	10	“Shall I make us a nice goat stew?” he asked.	153
551	The Troll	2	“Goat? GOAT?	154
552	The Troll	8	But pirates don’t eat goat!” said Hank Chief.	155
553	The Troll	8	“We want what pirates are supposed to eat.”	156
554	The Troll	6	“And what’s that?” asked the troll.	157
555	The Troll	5	“Fish,” said the pirate chief.	158
556	The Storm Whale In Winter	11	Noi lived with his dad and six cats by the sea.	0
557	The Storm Whale In Winter	13	Last summer, Noi rescued a little whale after a storm washed it ashore.	1
558	The Storm Whale In Winter	13	He and his dad took it back to the sea, where it belonged.	2
559	The Storm Whale In Winter	7	But Noi could not forget his friend.	3
560	The Storm Whale In Winter	20	Now and then he thought he caught a glimpse of the whale, its tail tipping the waves in the distance.	4
561	The Storm Whale In Winter	6	But it was always something else.	5
562	The Storm Whale In Winter	15	Winter was setting in, and all around the island the sea slowly filled with ice.	6
563	The Storm Whale In Winter	10	Noi’s dad took one last trip in his fishing boat.	7
564	The Storm Whale In Winter	17	But when darkness fell that evening, his dad was still not home and Noi began to worry.	8
565	The Storm Whale In Winter	7	Noi watched and waited, waited and watched.	9
566	The Storm Whale In Winter	7	Suddenly he saw something out at sea.	10
567	The Storm Whale In Winter	9	It was his dad - it had to be!	11
568	The Storm Whale In Winter	13	He counted all six cats safe inside and dashed down to the shore.	12
569	The Storm Whale In Winter	14	Noi dragged his boat to the water’s edge but the sea was frozen hard.	13
570	The Storm Whale In Winter	4	"""I must be careful!”"	14
571	The Storm Whale In Winter	9	he thought, stepping out on to the thick ice.	15
572	The Storm Whale In Winter	14	The further Noi went the harder the snow fell, until everywhere looked the same.	16
573	The Storm Whale In Winter	3	Noi was lost!	17
574	The Storm Whale In Winter	12	Then up ahead he saw a grey shape flickering in the lamplight.	18
575	The Storm Whale In Winter	9	It was his dad’s boat stuck in the ice.	19
576	The Storm Whale In Winter	4	Noi quickly clambered aboard.	20
577	The Storm Whale In Winter	1	“Dad?”	21
578	The Storm Whale In Winter	2	Noi called.	22
579	The Storm Whale In Winter	9	But his voice echoed - the boat was empty.	23
580	The Storm Whale In Winter	6	Noi didn’t know what to do.	24
581	The Storm Whale In Winter	19	As he curled up tight he imagined the deep sea swirling beneath him and he began to feel afraid.	25
582	The Storm Whale In Winter	8	Then through the darkness, the boat went BUMP!	26
583	The Storm Whale In Winter	5	It was the storm whale.	27
584	The Storm Whale In Winter	8	The whole family had come to help Noi.	28
585	The Storm Whale In Winter	10	The whales pushed their noses into the cold night air.	29
586	The Storm Whale In Winter	14	They sang through puffs of steam and spray as the ice cracked and crunched.	30
587	The Storm Whale In Winter	6	Somehow they knew where to go.	31
588	The Storm Whale In Winter	8	The little boat thumped hard against the rocks.	32
589	The Storm Whale In Winter	3	“Dad!” cried Noi.	33
590	The Storm Whale In Winter	1	“Noi!	34
591	The Storm Whale In Winter	8	What are you doing here?” said his dad.	35
592	The Storm Whale In Winter	8	“I just had to find you!” said Noi.	36
593	The Storm Whale In Winter	14	As winter turned slowly to spring they often spoke of that cold, icy night.	37
594	The Storm Whale In Winter	14	The night the fishermen had rescued Dad, and the storm whale had rescued Noi.	38
595	The Storm Whale In Winter	15	And Noi would smile ... ... because it was the night his friend came back.	39

643	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	12	Once upon a magic forest, there was a little girl called June.	0
644	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	12	June knew the woods were full of treasures waiting to be discovered.	1
645	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	20	She loved to climb through the tallest trees to find castles, and peer through the bushes to find magic wands.	2
646	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	10	Then one day June found the greatest treasure of all...	3
647	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	6	Tiny magic horses learning to fly!	4
648	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	4	June couldn’t believe it.	5
649	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	14	They shook their soft fur, fluttered their sparkly tails, and whizzed into the air.	6
650	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	9	But there was one little horse that wasn’t flying.	7
651	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	4	He looked very sad.	8
652	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	5	“Are you ok little horsie?”	9
653	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	2	June asked.	10
654	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	3	“Can’t you fly?”	11
655	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	4	He shook his head.	12
656	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	6	“I can help you,” said June.	13
657	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	12	“We just have to make your fur shake and your tail flutter.”	14
658	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	13	So they tried rolling, and jumping, and running really fast, but nothing happened.	15
659	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	9	“I guess we’ll have to use magic,” said June.	16
660	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	15	She rummaged through her box of treasures until she found her most powerful magic wand.	17
661	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	10	June swooshed a big swoosh and wished a big wish...	18
662	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	5	But it still didn’t work.	19
663	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	11	The little horse was sadder than ever, and so was June.	20
664	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	14	As soon as she got home, Mum and Dad could tell something was wrong.	21
665	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	9	Not even her favourite dinner could make her smile.	22
666	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	8	June told them all about the tiny horse.	23
667	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	12	“I tried to help but my magic want didn’t work,” she said.	24
668	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	4	“I think it’s broken.”	25
669	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	6	“Don’t worry,” Mum and Dad said.	26
670	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	5	“We can fix it together!”	27
671	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	6	“How do we fix my wand?”	28
672	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	2	Said June.	29
673	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	11	“Let’s start by trying to cheer up your friend,” said Mum.	30
674	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	15	“Tomorrow, we’ll think of all the things that a little horse might like,” said Dad.	31
675	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	6	The next morning, everyone thought hard.	32
676	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	4	“Something sweet?” said June.	33
677	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	4	“Something happy?” said Dad.	34
678	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	7	“What about something to share?” said Mum.	35
679	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	4	"""I know,” said June."	36
680	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	5	“Let’s give him an ice-cream!”	37
681	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	19	Just before she left, Mum and Dad whispered a magic formula to make sure the ice-cream tasted super sweet.	38
682	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	8	June couldn’t wait to cheer up her friend.	39
683	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	14	She ran as fast as she could, but it was a little too fast.	40
684	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	12	She tripped, then the ice cream slipped out of her hand, and...	41
685	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	5	SMUSH It was a disaster.	42
686	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	14	But then June saw that the little horse liked his new horn very much.	43
687	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	6	After all, it was Perfectly delicious!	44
688	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	19	He smiled, then he laughed, then he shook his soft fur and fluttered his sparkly tail... and it worked!	45
689	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	6	It was the happiest day ever.	46
690	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	25	Ever since, magic horses have been called unicorns, for they all wear horns to remember the day when a little girl was a good friend.	47
691	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	12	June often wears hers too and she never forgets the magic formula.	48
692	Once Upon A Unicorn Horn	12	My magic is deep inside, I don’t need a wand to fly	49

738	The Princess and the Wizard	6	It was Princess Eliza s birthday.	0
739	The Princess and the Wizard	31	She was just blowing out the seven candles on her cake when a wicked wizard flew down the chimney and into the room “Why didn’t you invite me to your party?”	1
740	The Princess and the Wizard	2	he thundered.	2
741	The Princess and the Wizard	11	"“Because wicked wizards like turning people to stone,"" replied Princess Eliza."	3
742	The Princess and the Wizard	27	“So they do,” said the Wizard, and with a flick of his bony fingers he turned the King, the Queen and all the party guests into stone.	4
743	The Princess and the Wizard	16	"Then he laughed a horrible laugh and said to Princess Eliza, ""They like capturing princesses too."""	5
744	The Princess and the Wizard	18	Just then there was a whirring of wings and in through the window flew the Princess’s Fairy Godmother.	6
745	The Princess and the Wizard	6	She was late for the party.	7
746	The Princess and the Wizard	28	When she saw what had happened, she waved her wand and said: “The princess may try seven times to escape By changing her colour and changing her shape.”	8
747	The Princess and the Wizard	22	The Wizard just laughed his horrible laugh and said: “Changing her colour and changing her shape Will never help Princess Eliza escape.”	9
748	The Princess and the Wizard	14	Then he snapped his bony fingers again and turned the Fairy Godmother to stone.	10
749	The Princess and the Wizard	17	The Wizard whisked the Princess up the chimney and carried her away to his tall dark castle.	11
750	The Princess and the Wizard	12	He locked her into the cellar, where she cried herself to sleep.	12
751	The Princess and the Wizard	5	The next day was Monday.	13
752	The Princess and the Wizard	6	The Wizard unlocked the cellar door.	14
753	The Princess and the Wizard	12	He was holding the big red book which contained all his magic.	15
754	The Princess and the Wizard	9	"“This is your first chance to escape,"" he said."	16
755	The Princess and the Wizard	14	"“I shall count to one hundred and then I shall come and find you."""	17
756	The Princess and the Wizard	11	He opened his book, closed his eyes and began to count.	18
757	The Princess and the Wizard	4	Princess Eliza ran outside.	19
758	The Princess and the Wizard	11	The moat of the castle shone blue under the blue sky.	20
759	The Princess and the Wizard	12	She jumped into the water and turned herself into a blue fish.	21
760	The Princess and the Wizard	4	"""Ninety-eight, ninety-nine, a hundred!”"	22
761	The Princess and the Wizard	30	The Wizard opened his eyes, looked in his magic book and read: To find where Eliza is hiding from you, Look in the moat for the fish that is blue.	23
762	The Princess and the Wizard	23	He fished Eliza out of the moat and took her to his kitchen, which was full of blue plates and pots and pans.	24
763	The Princess and the Wizard	7	They were all covered in dried-up food.	25
764	The Princess and the Wizard	8	"""So you like blue, do you?” he said."	26
765	The Princess and the Wizard	6	"""Then set to work and wash!”"	27
766	The Princess and the Wizard	5	And he locked her in.	28
767	The Princess and the Wizard	9	On Tuesday morning the Wizard unlocked the kitchen door.	29
768	The Princess and the Wizard	13	He looked at the clean plates and pots and pans and he grunted.	30
769	The Princess and the Wizard	5	“Chance number two,” he said.	31
770	The Princess and the Wizard	12	Then he opened his book, closed his eyes and began to count.	32
771	The Princess and the Wizard	6	Princess Eliza ran to the farmyard.	33
772	The Princess and the Wizard	12	She turned herself into a yellow chick and hid in some straw.	34
773	The Princess and the Wizard	16	But the Wizard read in his book: The straw in the farmyard., is yellow and thick.	35
774	The Princess and the Wizard	6	Princess Eliza’s disguised as a chick.	36
775	The Princess and the Wizard	16	He scooped Eliza up and took her to a cupboard which was full of yellow socks.	37
776	The Princess and the Wizard	11	They all had holes in them, made by his pointy toenails.	38
777	The Princess and the Wizard	8	"“So you like yellow, do you?"" he said."	39
778	The Princess and the Wizard	6	"“Then set to work and darn!"""	40
779	The Princess and the Wizard	5	And he locked her in.	41
780	The Princess and the Wizard	16	On Wednesday morning the Wizard unlocked the cupboard door, looked at the darned socks and grunted.	42
781	The Princess and the Wizard	17	"“Chance number three,"" he said, and he opened his book, closed his eyes and began to count."	43
782	The Princess and the Wizard	6	Princess Eliza ran to the meadow.	44
783	The Princess and the Wizard	13	She changed herself into a green grasshopper and hid among the grass blades.	45
784	The Princess and the Wizard	20	But the Wizard read in his book: The grasshopper princess is easily seen Chirping away in the meadow so green.	46
785	The Princess and the Wizard	7	He caught Eliza in a net and.	47
786	The Princess and the Wizard	6	took her to his green bathroom.	48
787	The Princess and the Wizard	13	The bath, basin, walls and floor were covered in the Wizard’s slimy toothpaste.	49
788	The Princess and the Wizard	8	"“So you like green, do you?"" he said."	50
789	The Princess and the Wizard	6	"“Then set to work and wipe!"""	51
790	The Princess and the Wizard	5	And he locked her in.	52
791	The Princess and the Wizard	5	Three more days went by.	53
792	The Princess and the Wizard	7	Each day the Princess tried to escape.	54
793	The Princess and the Wizard	17	On Thursday she turned herself into an orange fox and hid in a pile of orange leaves.	55
794	The Princess and the Wizard	15	On Friday she turned herself into a purple butterfly and fluttered among some purple flowers.	56
795	The Princess and the Wizard	15	On Saturday she turned herself into a black cat and lurked in a black tunnel.	57
796	The Princess and the Wizard	15	But each time the Wizard found her and gave her yet more work to do.	58
797	The Princess and the Wizard	19	On Sunday morning, the Wizard came on to the roof where Eliza had been scrubbing the sooty chimney pots.	59
798	The Princess and the Wizard	8	Instead of grunting, he laughed his horrible laugh.	60
799	The Princess and the Wizard	7	“This is your last chance,” he said.	61
800	The Princess and the Wizard	19	“If I catch you this time, you must stay and work for me for the rest of your life.”	62
801	The Princess and the Wizard	12	Then he opened his book, closed his eyes and began to count.	63
802	The Princess and the Wizard	14	Princess Eliza turned herself into a white gull and flew up into a cloud.	64
803	The Princess and the Wizard	24	But as she hovered above the roof where the Wizard was still counting, she saw words forming on the page of his open book.	65
804	The Princess and the Wizard	6	"“So that’s how he finds me!"""	66
805	The Princess and the Wizard	2	she cried.	67
806	The Princess and the Wizard	4	"""I shall never escape!"""	68
807	The Princess and the Wizard	5	Then she had an idea.	69
808	The Princess and the Wizard	21	She turned herself into a page of the Wizard’s book - a perfectly blank white page, with no writing on it.	70
809	The Princess and the Wizard	4	“Ninety-eight, ninety-nine, a hundred!”	71
810	The Princess and the Wizard	19	The Wizard finished counting and began to read his book: The Princess turned into a bird in the sky.	72
811	The Princess and the Wizard	11	She hid in a cloud, then she had one more try.	73
812	The Princess and the Wizard	7	That was the end of the page.	74
813	The Princess and the Wizard	7	The Wizard turned over to read more.	75
814	The Princess and the Wizard	5	But there was no more.	76
815	The Princess and the Wizard	10	The next page in his book was blank and white.	77
816	The Princess and the Wizard	5	He flew into a RAGE!	78
817	The Princess and the Wizard	3	“You stupid book!”	79
818	The Princess and the Wizard	9	he shouted, and he hurled it into the moat.	80

873	Kipper's Toybox	8	There, wriggling across the floor, was Sock Thing!	35
874	Kipper's Toybox	12	It must have been Sock Thing who had been eating his toybox!	36
875	Kipper's Toybox	7	Kipper was not sure what to do.	37
876	Kipper's Toybox	10	None of his toys had ever come to life before.	38
877	Kipper's Toybox	11	He jumped back in his basket and hid behind Big Owl.	39
878	Kipper's Toybox	13	Sock Thing wiggled slowly round in a circle and bumped into the basket.	40

947	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	4	“He wants his teddy.	3
948	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	13	We took Teddy with us on a picnic and somewhere we lost it.”	4

950	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	5	“I’ll lend him my teddy.	6
951	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	7	Tomorrow I’ll look for the lost one.”	7
952	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	9	Elmer went away and came back, with his teddy.	8
953	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	13	Baby Elephant smiled and was soon fast asleep with Elmer’s teddy beside him.	9
954	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	12	The next day Elmer set off in search of the lost teddy.	10
955	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	10	He hadn’t gone far when he met his cousin, Wilbur.	11
956	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	4	“Hello, Wilbur,” said Elmer.	12
957	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	7	“I’m looking for Baby Elephant’s lost teddy.	13
958	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	4	Have you seen it?”	14
959	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	3	“No,” said Wilbur.	15
960	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	8	“But if I find it, I’ll call you.”	16
961	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	8	A little later a voice said, “Hello, Elmer.	17
962	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	16	Where are you” “Baby Elephant has lost his teddy and I’m looking for it, said Elmer.	18
963	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	4	“Oh dear,” said Lion.	19

975	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	7	“The twins wouldn’t sleep without their teddies.	31
976	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	7	If I find it, I’ll call you.”	32

978	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	15	All the young ones had their teddies, but none of them had seen Baby Elephant’s.	34
979	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	13	They all said the same thing, “If we find it, we’ll call you.”	35
980	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	12	It was getting late into the afternoon and Teddy was still lost.	36
981	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	8	“I hope I find him soon,” thought Elmer.	37
982	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	3	“It’s nearly night-time.”	38

994	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	6	“Please, take me home” said Teddy.	50
995	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	6	“I can’t sleep without Baby Elephant.”	51
996	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	3	Elmer still stared.	52
997	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	6	“Your mouth isn’t moving,” he said.	53
998	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	7	Just then Wilbur appeared from the bushes.	54
999	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	3	“Wilbur” laughed Elmer.	55
1000	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	10	“I might have known it was you making Teddy speak.”	56
1001	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	2	Wilbur chuckled.	57
1002	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	11	“I said I’d call you if I found Teddy” he said.	58
1003	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	3	“And I did.	59
1004	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	9	Come on, let’s take Teddy home, it’s getting dark.”	60

1006	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	15	Baby Elephant was excited to see his teddy again and quickly gave back Elmer’s teddy.	62
1007	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	9	Baby Elephant’s mother couldn’t thank Elmer and Wilbur enough.	63
1008	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	15	“Elmer,” said Wilbur, “weren’t you worried that Baby Elephant would want to keep your teddy?	64
1009	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	7	Your teddy is very different; it’s special.”	65
1010	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	9	‘But, Wilbur, didn’t you know?” said Elmer in surprise.	66
1011	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	9	“You don’t have to be different to be special.	67
1012	Elmer and the Lost Teddy	7	All teddies are special, especially your own.”	68

1037	A Squash and a Squeeze	4	What a curious plan.”	6
1038	A Squash and a Squeeze	19	Well, the hen laid an egg on the fireside rug, And flapped round the room knocking over the jug.	7
1039	A Squash and a Squeeze	9	The little old lady cried, “What shall I do?	8
1040	A Squash and a Squeeze	5	It was poky for one	9

1042	A Squash and a Squeeze	11	My nose has a tickle and there’s no room to sneeze.	11
1043	A Squash and a Squeeze	8	My house is a squash and a squeeze.”	12

1049	A Squash and a Squeeze	19	Well, the goat chewed the curtains and trod on the egg, then sat down to nibble the table leg.	18
1050	A Squash and a Squeeze	7	The little old lady cried, “Glory be!	19
1051	A Squash and a Squeeze	10	It was tiny for two and it’s titchy for three.	20
1052	A Squash and a Squeeze	10	The hen pecks the goat and the goat’s got fleas.	21
1053	A Squash and a Squeeze	8	My house is a squash and a squeeze.”	22
1054	A Squash and a Squeeze	11	And she said, “Wise old man, won’t you help me, please?	23

1076	A Squash and a Squeeze	9	“But then I’ll be back where I first began.”	45
1077	A Squash and a Squeeze	10	So she opened the window and out flew the hen.	46
1078	A Squash and a Squeeze	9	“That’s better - at last I can sneeze again.”	47
1079	A Squash and a Squeeze	11	She shooed out the goat and she shoved out the pig.	48
1080	A Squash and a Squeeze	8	“My house is beginning to feel pretty big.”	49
1081	A Squash and a Squeeze	11	She huffed and she puffed and she pushed out the cow.	50

1091	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	11	Keith the cat w as merrily minding his own business when...	0
1092	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	1	Wheee!	1
1093	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	1	Plop!	2
1094	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	11	“Ha-ha-ha, Keith’s got a n ice cream stuck on his head!	3
1095	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	4	chuckled the other cats.	4
1096	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	19	"Suddenly, Keith felt a little bit shy and a little bit silly ""It’s not an ice cream,"" he squeaked."	5
1097	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	2	“It’s a...	6
1098	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	2	It’s a...	7
1099	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	2	It’s a...	8
1100	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	4	It's a... MAGIC HAT!	9
1101	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	3	Yes that’s it!	10
1102	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	3	A MAGIC HAT!”	11
1103	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	14	This made the cats laugh even louder “Go on then, show us some magic!”	12
1104	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	2	they chortled.	13
1105	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	2	Poor Keith!	14
1106	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	6	What was he going to do?	15
1107	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	9	“W-w-well first,” stammered Keith, “I need my magic wand.”	16
1108	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	11	He reached for the chocolatey magic wand on the ground but...	17
1109	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	9	It started to run away - ALL by itself!	18
1110	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	4	The cats were amazed.	19
1111	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	2	“Wow, Keith!	20
1112	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	7	You m ade it move,” they gasped.	21
1113	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	10	Keith was amazed too... but he di dn’t say anything.	22
1114	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	1	"“More!"""	23
1115	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	5	the cats cried, excite dly.	24
1116	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	2	“More magic.	25
1117	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	1	More!	26
1118	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	1	"More!"""	27
1119	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	5	Keith took a deep breath.	28
1120	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	7	Then he waved his wand around... “Abracadabra!”	29
1121	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	3	But nothing happened.	30
1122	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	3	Keith tried again.	31
1123	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	1	“Alacazoo!”	32
1124	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	3	Still nothing happened.	33
1125	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	5	The cats were getting impatient.	34
1126	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	7	They chanted and stamped their feet “MORE!	35
1127	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	1	MORE!	36
1128	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	1	"MORE!"""	37
1129	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	6	“Whizzy-whoo-do-da!” cried Keith AND... .. .just	38
1130	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	11	then, a whole family of rabbits popped out of the ground.	39
1131	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	6	They’d never heard such a noise!	40
1132	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	5	“Keith - you did it!”	41
1133	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	5	the other cats ch eered.	42
1134	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	5	“You magicked up some rabbits.	43
1135	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	1	"Hooray!"""	44
1136	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	15	They were all having such a fun time that they didn't hear a distant WOOF!	45
1137	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	1	WOOF!	46
1138	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	1	WOOF!	47
1139	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	1	WOOF!	48
1140	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	1	"""Yikes!"	49
1141	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	2	A dog!	50
1142	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	7	Quick, Keith, save us with your magic!”	51
1143	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	6	the cats squealed in panic WOOF!	52
1144	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	1	WOOF!	53
1145	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	1	WOOF!	54
1146	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	8	But, of course, Keith couldn’t REALLY do magic.	55
1147	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	6	What was he going to do?	56
1148	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	6	The cats ran up the tree.	57
1149	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	7	They looked down at the barking dog.	58
1150	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	4	"""Quick, Keith, DO something!”"	59
1151	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	2	they cried.	60
1152	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	8	Then... Keith’s magic hat slipped off his head.	61
1153	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	8	I t was falling quickly through the air...	62
1154	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	1	PLOP!	63
1155	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	2	“Oh no!	64
1156	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	6	"Your magic hat!"" cried, the cats."	65
1157	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	10	“Now you’ll NEVER be able to make the dog disappear.”	66
1158	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	3	Keith felt terrible.	67
1159	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	8	“It’s not a magic hat,” he admitted sadly.	68
1160	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	20	“You were right all along - it’s just an ice cream, and now we are stuck up this tree FOREVER!	69
1161	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	2	"I’m sorry!"""	70
1162	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	9	But then... BUZZZZZZZZZ “Hooray for Keith!” cried the cats.	71
1163	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	6	"“You’re magic even without your hat!"""	72
1164	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	26	"“Thank you,” said Keith shyly “And , for my next trick, I will make this blob of ice cream on the end of my nose disappear."""	73
1165	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	4	The cats waited patiently.	74
1166	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	1	Then...	75
1167	Keith The Cat With The Magic Hat	9	Keith stuck out his tongue and licked it off!	76
1168	Santa is Coming to Devon	4	Devon “Well?” boomed Santa.	0
1169	Santa is Coming to Devon	9	"""Have all the children from been good this year?”"	1
1170	Santa is Coming to Devon	18	"""Well… erm… mostly,” answered the little old elf, as he bustled across the busy workshop to Santa's desk."	2
1171	Santa is Coming to Devon	22	Santa peered down at the elf from behind the tall, teetering piles of letters that the children of Devon had sent him.	3
1172	Santa is Coming to Devon	10	"""Mostly?” asked Santa, looking over the top of his glasses."	4
1173	Santa is Coming to Devon	14	"especially ""Yes...but they’ve all been good in the last few days!"" said the elf."	5
1174	Santa is Coming to Devon	2	“Jolly good!”	6
1175	Santa is Coming to Devon	2	chuckled Santa.	7
1176	Santa is Coming to Devon	8	“Then we’d better get their presents loaded up!”	8
1177	Santa is Coming to Devon	28	Even though the sack of presents was really really big and the elves were really really small, they seemed to have no trouble loading it onto Santa’s sleigh.	9
1178	Santa is Coming to Devon	18	Though how they managed to fit such a big sack onto one little sleigh even they didn’t know.	10
1179	Santa is Coming to Devon	4	But somehow they did.	11
1180	Santa is Coming to Devon	1	“Splendid!”	12
1181	Santa is Coming to Devon	6	“We’re ready to go!” boomed Santa.	13
1182	Santa is Coming to Devon	2	“Er...not quite.	14
1183	Santa is Coming to Devon	6	"Santa,"" said the little old elf."	15
1184	Santa is Coming to Devon	6	"“One of our reindeer is missing!"""	16
1185	Santa is Coming to Devon	1	“Missing?	17
1186	Santa is Coming to Devon	6	"Which reindeer is missing?"" asked Santa."	18
1187	Santa is Coming to Devon	7	"“The youngest one, Santa,"" said the elf."	19
1188	Santa is Coming to Devon	5	“It’s his first flight tonight.	20
1189	Santa is Coming to Devon	7	I’ve called him and called him, but...”	21
1190	Santa is Coming to Devon	12	Just then, a young reindeer strolled up, munching on a large carrot.	22
1191	Santa is Coming to Devon	6	“Where have you been?” asked Santa.	23
1192	Santa is Coming to Devon	20	The youngest reindeer was crunching so loudly that it was no wonder he hadn't heard the little old elf calling.	24
1193	Santa is Coming to Devon	12	"“Oh well, never mind,"" said Santa, giving the reindeer a little wink."	25
1194	Santa is Coming to Devon	12	He took out his Santa-nav and tapped in the postcode for Devon.	26
1195	Santa is Coming to Devon	9	“This will guide us to Devon in no time.”	27
1196	Santa is Coming to Devon	19	With a flick of the reigns and a jerk of the harness, off they went, racing through the sky.	28
1197	Santa is Coming to Devon	3	“Ho-ho-ho!” laughed Santa.	29
1198	Santa is Coming to Devon	10	"""We’ll soon have these parcels delivered to dear old Devon!”"	30
1199	Santa is Coming to Devon	13	Santa’s sleigh flew through the starry night heading south across the Irish Sea.	31
1200	Santa is Coming to Devon	10	On they flew in the crisp, wintery air over Wales.	32
1201	Santa is Coming to Devon	18	In the wink of an eye, the sleigh was flying above the British Channel and on to Devon.	33
1202	Santa is Coming to Devon	6	The youngest reindeer was very excited.	34
1203	Santa is Coming to Devon	10	He had never been away from the North Pole before.	35
1204	Santa is Coming to Devon	14	n They were just crossing over Exmoor when, suddenly, they ran into a blizzard.	36
1205	Santa is Coming to Devon	5	Snowflakes whirled around the sleigh.	37
1206	Santa is Coming to Devon	5	They couldn’t see a thing!	38
1207	Santa is Coming to Devon	13	The youngest reindeer was getting a bit worried, but Santa didn’t seem concerned.	39
1208	Santa is Coming to Devon	17	“In two kilometres...” said the Santa-nav in a bossy lady’s voice, “...keep left at the next star.”	40
1209	Santa is Coming to Devon	13	"“But, Madam,"" Santa blustered, “I can’t see any stars in all this snow!"""	41
1210	Santa is Coming to Devon	5	Soon they were hopelessly lost!	42
1211	Santa is Coming to Devon	12	Then, through the blizzard, the youngest reindeer heard a faint ringing sound.	43
1212	Santa is Coming to Devon	1	Ding-Dong!	44
1213	Santa is Coming to Devon	11	He looked over at the old reindeer with the red nose.	45
1214	Santa is Coming to Devon	6	But he had his head down.	46
1215	Santa is Coming to Devon	1	Ding-Dong!	47
1216	Santa is Coming to Devon	1	Ding-Dong!	48
1217	Santa is Coming to Devon	1	Ding-Dong!	49
1218	Santa is Coming to Devon	1	Dong-Dong!	50
1219	Santa is Coming to Devon	9	There was that sound again, like church bells ringing.	51
1220	Santa is Coming to Devon	9	The youngest reindeer turned round to look at Santa.	52
1221	Santa is Coming to Devon	4	But Santa wasn't listening.	53
1222	Santa is Coming to Devon	48	He seemed to be arguing with a little box with buttons on it With a flick of the harness and a jerk of the reins, the youngest reindeer gave a sharp tug and headed off towards the sound of the bells, pulling Santa and his sleigh behind him!	54
1223	Santa is Coming to Devon	7	“Whoa!” Cried Santa, pulling his hat straight.	55
1224	Santa is Coming to Devon	3	“What’s going on?”	56
1225	Santa is Coming to Devon	9	Then, to his surprise, he heard a ringing sound.	57
1226	Santa is Coming to Devon	4	“Well done, young reindeer!”	58
1227	Santa is Coming to Devon	3	he shouted cheerfully.	59
1228	Santa is Coming to Devon	11	“It must be the bells of St David's Church in Exeter.	60
1229	Santa is Coming to Devon	6	Don’t worry, children, Santa is coming!	61
1230	Santa is Coming to Devon	3	But, suddenly… CRUNCH!	62
1231	Santa is Coming to Devon	11	The sleigh hit something as it plummeted through the snow clouds.	63
1232	Santa is Coming to Devon	7	“You have arrived!” said the Santa-nav unhelpfully.	64
1233	Santa is Coming to Devon	25	Finally, when the snow had died down and the clouds parted, Santa discovered exactly where they were… stuck, right at the top of Exeter Cathedral!	65
1234	Santa is Coming to Devon	2	“Everybody, pull!”	66
1235	Santa is Coming to Devon	42	The reindeer pulled with all their might until, at last, with a screeching noise, the sleigh scraped clear of the tower and Santa steered them safely over Mol’s Coffee House, above the High Street, past the cinema and down into Belmont Park.	67
1236	Santa is Coming to Devon	15	Luckily, there was no real damage done, but the parcels had all been jumbled up.	68
1237	Santa is Coming to Devon	8	Santa quickly sorted the presents into order again.	69
1238	Santa is Coming to Devon	3	“Right” said Santa.	70
1239	Santa is Coming to Devon	11	"""Thanks to this young reindeer I know where we are now."	71
1240	Santa is Coming to Devon	6	Don’t worry, children, Santa is coming!”	72
1241	Santa is Coming to Devon	24	Santa drove his sleigh expertly from rooftop to rooftop all over Devon, popping in and out of chimneys as fast as he could go.	73
1242	Santa is Coming to Devon	11	There were big chimneys in Bideford and small chimneys in Sidmouth.	74
1243	Santa is Coming to Devon	14	He squeezed down thin chimneys in Exmouth and plummeted down fat chimneys in Paignton.	75
1244	Santa is Coming to Devon	18	The youngest reindeer was amazed at how quickly they went Santa never seemed to get tired at all!	76
1245	Santa is Coming to Devon	16	And it looked like the children in Devon were going to be very lucky this year!	77
1246	Santa is Coming to Devon	15	But the youngest reindeer was starting to feel a bit weary and quite hungry too.	78
1247	Santa is Coming to Devon	16	In house after house, Santa delved inside his sack for parcels of every shape and size.	79
1248	Santa is Coming to Devon	15	He piled them under the Christmas trees and carefully filled up the stockings with surprises.	80
1249	Santa is Coming to Devon	51	In house after house, the good children of Devon had left out a large mince pie, a small glass of something and a big, crunchy carrot Santa took a little bite out of each mince pie, a tiny sip of something, wiped his beard and popped the carrots into his sack.	81
1250	Santa is Coming to Devon	27	From Barnstaple to Brixham, from Ilfracombe to Ivybridge, from Tiverton to Torquay and ALL the place in between, Santa and his sleigh visited every house in Devon.	82
1251	Santa is Coming to Devon	10	Santa delivered presents to Alfie, Ava, Ben, Brooke, Charlie, Chloe..	83
1252	Santa is Coming to Devon	5	the list went on! …	84
1253	Santa is Coming to Devon	3	Zac, Zara, Zybil.	85
1254	Santa is Coming to Devon	12	Finally, Santa had delivered the last present on his long Devon list.	86
1255	Santa is Coming to Devon	6	“Great moons and stars!” sighed Santa.	87
1256	Santa is Coming to Devon	11	“It’s past midnight and my sack seems as heavy as ever!	88
1257	Santa is Coming to Devon	6	1 hope I haven’t forgotten anyone.”	89
1258	Santa is Coming to Devon	13	Santa opened his sack to check...but it was full of juicy, crunchy carrots!	90
1259	Santa is Coming to Devon	9	Santa shared out the carrots between all the reindeer.	91
1260	Santa is Coming to Devon	3	Well done, lad!	92
1261	Santa is Coming to Devon	10	he said, patting the youngest reindeer gently on the nose.	93
1262	Santa is Coming to Devon	11	But the youngest reindeer didn’t hear him...he was too busy munching!	94
1263	Santa is Coming to Devon	9	Then it was time to set off for home.	95
1264	Santa is Coming to Devon	31	Santa reset his Santa-nav for the North Pole and soon they were speeding above Salcombe, past the fishing boats in the harbour and over the sea through the crisp, starry night.	96
1265	Santa is Coming to Devon	3	“Ho-ho-ho!” laughed Santa.	97
1266	Santa is Coming to Devon	3	“Merry Christmas Devon!”	98
1267	The Enormous Crocodile	19	In the biggest brownest muddiest river in Africa, two crocodiles lay with their heads just above the water .	0
1268	The Enormous Crocodile	6	One of the crocodiles was enormous.	1
1269	The Enormous Crocodile	6	The other was not so big.	2
1270	The Enormous Crocodile	12	“Do you know what I wo uld like for my lunch today?”	3
1271	The Enormous Crocodile	4	the Enormous Crocodile asked.	4
1272	The Enormous Crocodile	5	"""No,” the Notsobig One said."	5
1273	The Enormous Crocodile	1	“What?”	6
1274	The Enormous Crocodile	10	The Enormous Crocodile grinned, showing hundreds of sharp white teeth.	7
1275	The Enormous Crocodile	15	“ For my lunch today,” he said, “I would like a nice juicy little child.”	8
1276	The Enormous Crocodile	8	“I never eat children,” the Notsobig One said.	9
1277	The Enormous Crocodile	2	"""Only fish.”"	10
1278	The Enormous Crocodile	7	“Ho, ho, ho!” cried the Enormous Crocodile.	11
1279	The Enormous Crocodile	14	"""I’ll bet if you saw a fat juicy little child paddling in the water"	12
1280	The Enormous Crocodile	14	ov er there at this very moment, you’d gulp him up in one gollop!”	13
1281	The Enormous Crocodile	7	“No, I wouldn’t,” the Notsobig One said.	14
1282	The Enormous Crocodile	7	“Children are to o tough and chewy.	15
1283	The Enormous Crocodile	9	They are tough and chewy and nasty and bitter.”	16
1284	The Enormous Crocodile	8	” Tough and chewy!” cried the Enormous Crocodile.	17
1285	The Enormous Crocodile	3	“Nasty and bitter!	18
1286	The Enormous Crocodile	5	What awful tommy-rot you talk!	19
1287	The Enormous Crocodile	5	They are juicy and yummy!”	20
1288	The Enormous Crocodile	20	“They taste so bitter,” the Notsobig One said, “you have to cover them with sugar before you can eat them.”	21
1289	The Enormous Crocodile	10	"""Children are bigg er than fish,” said the Enormous Crocodile."	22
1290	The Enormous Crocodile	4	"""You get bigger helpings.”"	23
1291	The Enormous Crocodile	7	"""You are greedy,” the Notsobig One said."	24
1292	The Enormous Crocodile	8	"""You’re the greediest croc in the whole river.”"	25
1293	The Enormous Crocodile	12	"""I’m the bravest croc in the whole river,” said the Enormous Crocodile."	26
1294	The Enormous Crocodile	26	"""I’m the only one who dares to leave the water and g o through the jungle to the town to look for little children to eat.”"	27
1295	The Enormous Crocodile	9	"""You’ve only done that once,” snorted the Notsobig One."	28
1296	The Enormous Crocodile	5	"""A nd what happened then?"	29
1297	The Enormous Crocodile	8	They all saw you coming and ran away.”	30
1298	The Enormous Crocodile	17	"""Ah, but today wh en I go, they won’t see me at all,” said the Enormous Crocodile."	31
1299	The Enormous Crocodile	9	"""Of course they’ll see you,” the Notsobig One said."	32
1300	The Enormous Crocodile	11	"""You’re so enormous and ugly, they’ll see you from miles away.”"	33
1301	The Enormous Crocodile	16	The Enormous Crocodile grinned again, and his terrible sharp teeth sparkled like knives in the sun.	34
1302	The Enormous Crocodile	18	"""Nobody will see me,” he sa id, ""because this time I’ve thought up secret plans and clever tricks.”"	35
1303	The Enormous Crocodile	6	"""Clever tricks?’ cried the Notsobig One."	36
1304	The Enormous Crocodile	9	"""You’ve never done anythin g clever in your life!"	37
1305	The Enormous Crocodile	8	You’re the stupidest croc on the whole river!”	38
1306	The Enormous Crocodile	12	"""I’m the cleverest croc on the whole river,” the Enormous Crocodile answered."	39
1307	The Enormous Crocodile	23	"""For my lunch today I shall feast upon a fat juicy little c hild while you lie here in the river feeling hungry."	40
1308	The Enormous Crocodile	1	Goodbye.”	41
1309	The Enormous Crocodile	17	The Enormous Crocod ile swam to the side of the river, and crawled out of the water.	42
1310	The Enormous Crocodile	10	A gigantic creature was standing in the slimy oozy m	43
1311	The Enormous Crocodile	4	ud on the river-bank.	44
1312	The Enormous Crocodile	5	It was Humpy-Rumpy, the Hippopotamus.	45
1313	The Enormous Crocodile	5	"""Hello, hello,” said H umpy-Rumpy."	46
1314	The Enormous Crocodile	12	"""Where on earth are you off to at this time of day?”"	47
1315	The Enormous Crocodile	10	"""I have secret plans and clever tricks,” said the Crocodile."	48
1316	The Enormous Crocodile	5	"""Oh dear,” said H umpy-Rumpy."	49
1317	The Enormous Crocodile	8	"""I’ll bet you’re going to do something horrid.”"	50
1318	The Enormous Crocodile	22	"The Enormous Crocodile grinned at Humpy-Rumpy and said: ""I’m going to fill my hungry empty tummy With something yummy yummy yummy yummy!”"	51
1319	The Enormous Crocodile	5	"""What’s so yummy?” asked Humpy-Rumpy."	52
1320	The Enormous Crocodile	6	"""Try to guess,” said the Crocodile."	53
1321	The Enormous Crocodile	7	"""It’s something that walks on two legs.”"	54
1322	The Enormous Crocodile	7	"""You don’t mean ...” said Hum py-Rumpy."	55
1323	The Enormous Crocodile	11	"""You don’t really mean you’re going to eat a little child?”"	56
1324	The Enormous Crocodile	7	"""Of course I am,” said the Crocodile."	57
1325	The Enormous Crocodile	10	"""Oh, you horrid greedy grumptious brute!” cried Humpy- Rumpy ."	58
1326	The Enormous Crocodile	12	"""I hope you get caught and cooked and turned into crocodile soup!”"	59
1327	The Enormous Crocodile	8	The Enormous Crocodile laughed out loud at Humpy-Rumpy.	60
1328	The Enormous Crocodile	7	Then he waddled off into the jungle.	61
1329	The Enormous Crocodile	8	Inside the jungle, he met Trunky, the Elephant.	62
1330	The Enormous Crocodile	20	Trunky was nibbling leaves from the top of a tall tree, and he d idn’t notice the Crocodile at first.	63
1331	The Enormous Crocodile	8	So the Crocodile bit him on the leg.	64
1332	The Enormous Crocodile	8	"""Ow!” said Trunky in his big deep voice."	65
1333	The Enormous Crocodile	3	"""Who did that?"	66
1334	The Enormous Crocodile	5	Oh, it’s you, is it,	67
1335	The Enormous Crocodile	3	you beastly Crocodile.	68
1336	The Enormous Crocodile	15	W hy don’t you go back to the big brown muddy river where you belong?”	69
1337	The Enormous Crocodile	10	"""I have secret plans and clever tricks,” said the Crocodile."	70
1338	The Enormous Crocodile	10	"""You mean you’ve nasty plans and nasty tricks,” said Trunky."	71
1339	The Enormous Crocodile	9	"""You’ve never done a nice thing in your life.”"	72
1340	The Enormous Crocodile	18	The Enormous Crocodile grinned up at Trunky and said: 'I’m off to find a yummy child for lunch.	73
1341	The Enormous Crocodile	9	Keep listening and you’ll hear the bones go crunch!”	74
1342	The Enormous Crocodile	7	"""Oh, you wicked beastly beast!” cried Trunky."	75
1343	The Enormous Crocodile	6	"""Oh, you foul and filthy fiend!"	76
1344	The Enormous Crocodile	16	I hope you get squ ashed and squished and squizzled and boiled up into crocodile stew!”	77
1345	The Enormous Crocodile	13	The Enorm ous Crocodile laughed out loud and disappeared into the thick jungle.	78
1346	The Enormous Crocodile	10	A bit further on, he met Mugg le-Wump, the Monkey.	79
1347	The Enormous Crocodile	9	Muggle- Wump was sitting in a tree, eating nuts.	80
1348	The Enormous Crocodile	4	"""Hello, Crocky,” said Muggle-Wump."	81
1349	The Enormous Crocodile	6	"""What are you up to now?”"	82
1350	The Enormous Crocodile	11	"""I have secret plans and clever tricks,” said the Croco dile."	83
1351	The Enormous Crocodile	7	"""Would you like some nuts?” asked Muggle-Wump."	84
1352	The Enormous Crocodile	11	"""I have better things to eat than nuts,” sniffed the Crocodile."	85
1353	The Enormous Crocodile	13	"""I did n’t think there was anything better than nuts,” said Muggle- Wump."	86
1354	The Enormous Crocodile	22	"""Ah-ha,” said the Enormous Crocodile, ""The sort of things that I’m going to eat Have fingers, toe-nails, arms and legs and feet!”"	87
1355	The Enormous Crocodile	9	Muggle-Wump went pale and began to shake all over.	88
1356	The Enormous Crocodile	12	"""You aren’t really going to gobble up a little child, are you?”"	89
1357	The Enormous Crocodile	2	he said.	90
1358	The Enormous Crocodile	8	"""Of course I am,” said th e Crocodile."	91
1359	The Enormous Crocodile	3	"""Clothes and all."	92
1360	The Enormous Crocodile	7	They taste better with the clothes on.”	93
1361	The Enormous Crocodile	7	"""Oh, you horrid hoggish croc!” cried Muggle-Wump."	94
1362	The Enormous Crocodile	3	"""You slimy creature!"	95
1363	The Enormous Crocodile	17	I hope the b uttons and buckles all stick in your throat and choke you to death!”	96
1364	The Enormous Crocodile	12	"The Crocodile grinned up at Muggle-Wump and said, ""I eat monkeys, too.”"	97
1365	The Enormous Crocodile	26	And quick as a flash, with one bite of his huge jaws, he bit through the tree that Muggle-Wump was sitting in, and down it came.	98
1366	The Enormous Crocodile	17	But just in time, Muggle-Wump j umped into the next tree and swung away through the branches.	99
1367	The Enormous Crocodile	12	A bit further on, the Enormous Crocodile met the Roly- Poly Bird.	100
1368	The Enormous Crocodile	11	The Roly-Poly Bird was building a nest in an orange tree.	101
1369	The Enormous Crocodile	8	"""Hello there, Enormous Crocodile!” sang the Roly-Poly Bird."	102
1370	The Enormous Crocodile	10	"""We don’t often see you up here in the jungle.”"	103
1371	The Enormous Crocodile	4	"""Ah,” said the Crocodile."	104
1372	The Enormous Crocodile	8	"""I have secret plans and clev er tricks."	105
1373	The Enormous Crocodile	11	"""I hope it’s not something nasty,” sang the Roly-Poly Bird ."	106
1374	The Enormous Crocodile	5	"""Nasty!” cri ed the Crocodile."	107
1375	The Enormous Crocodile	5	"""Of course it’s not nasty!"	108
1376	The Enormous Crocodile	2	It’s delicious!”	109
1377	The Enormous Crocodile	14	"""It’s luscious, it’s super, It’s mushious, it’s duper, It’s better than rotten old fish."	110
1378	The Enormous Crocodile	6	You mash it and mun ch	111
1379	The Enormous Crocodile	7	it, You chew it and crunch it!	112
1380	The Enormous Crocodile	7	It’s lovely to hear it go squish!”	113
1381	The Enormous Crocodile	8	"""It must be berries,” sang the Roly-Poly Bird."	114
1382	The Enormous Crocodile	9	"""Berr ies are my favourite food in the world."	115
1383	The Enormous Crocodile	5	I s it raspberries, perhaps?	116
1384	The Enormous Crocodile	5	Or could it be strawberries?”	117
1385	The Enormous Crocodile	15	The Enormous Crocodile laughed so much his teeth rattled together like pennies in a moneybox.	118
1386	The Enormous Crocodile	6	"""Crocodiles don’t eat berries,” he said."	119
1387	The Enormous Crocodile	6	"""We eat little boys and girls."	120
1388	The Enormous Crocodile	8	And sometimes we eat Roly-Poly Birds, as well.”	121
1389	The Enormous Crocodile	14	Very quickly, the Crocodile reached up and snapped his jaws at the Roly-Poly Bird.	122
1390	The Enormous Crocodile	19	He just missed the Bird, but he managed to catch hold of the long beautiful feathers in its tail.	123
1391	The Enormous Crocodile	25	The Roly-Poly Bird gave a shriek of terror and shot straight up into the air, leaving its tail feathers behind in the Enormous Crocodile’s mouth.	124
1392	The Enormous Crocodile	17	At last, the Enormous Crocodile came out of the other side of the jungle into the sunshine.	125
1393	The Enormous Crocodile	8	He could see the town not far away.	126
1394	The Enormous Crocodile	1	"""Ho-ho!”"	127
1395	The Enormous Crocodile	6	he said, talking aloud to himself.	128
1396	The Enormous Crocodile	1	"""Ha-ha!"	129
1397	The Enormous Crocodile	11	That walk through the jungle has made me hungrier than ever.	130
1398	The Enormous Crocodile	11	One child isn’t going to be nearly enough for me today.	131
1399	The Enormous Crocodile	14	I won’t be full up until I’ve eaten at least three juicy little children!”	132
1400	The Enormous Crocodile	8	He started to creep forward towards the town.	133
1401	The Enormous Crocodile	17	The Enormous Cr ocodile crept over to a place where there were a lot of coconut trees.	134
1402	The Enormous Crocodile	13	He knew that children from the town often came here looking for coconuts.	135
1403	The Enormous Crocodile	23	The trees were too tall for them to climb, but the re were always some coconuts on the ground that had fallen down.	136
1404	The Enormous Crocodile	14	The Enormous Crocodile quickly collected all the coconuts that were lying on the ground.	137
1405	The Enormous Crocodile	7	He also gathered together several fallen branches.	138
1406	The Enormous Crocodile	6	“Now for Clever Trick Number One!”	139
1407	The Enormous Crocodile	5	he whispered to him self.	140
1408	The Enormous Crocodile	14	"""It won’t be long before I am eating the first part of my lunch!”"	141
1409	The Enormous Crocodile	12	He took all the coconut branches and held them between his teeth.	142
1410	The Enormous Crocodile	9	He grasped the coconuts in his front paw s.	143
1411	The Enormous Crocodile	13	Then he stood straight up in the air, balancing himself on his tail.	144
1412	The Enormous Crocodile	25	He arranged the branches and the coconuts so cleverly that he now looked exactly like a small coconut tree standing among the big coconut trees.	145
1413	The Enormous Crocodile	5	Soon, two children came along.	146
1414	The Enormous Crocodile	5	They were brother and sister.	147
1415	The Enormous Crocodile	5	The boy was called Toto.	148
1416	The Enormous Crocodile	5	His sister was called Mary.	149
1417	The Enormous Crocodile	22	They walked around looking for fallen coconuts, but they co uldn’t find any because the Enormous Crocodile had gathered them all up.	150
1418	The Enormous Crocodile	4	"""Oh look!” cried Toto."	151
1419	The Enormous Crocodile	10	"""That tree over there is much smaller than the others!"	152
1420	The Enormous Crocodile	6	And it’s full of coco nuts!	153
1421	The Enormous Crocodile	17	I think I could climb that one quite easily if you help me up the first bit.”	154
1422	The Enormous Crocodile	13	Toto and Mary ran towards what they thought was the small coconut tree.	155
1423	The Enormous Crocodile	15	The Enormous Crocodile peered through the branches, watching them as they came closer and closer.	156
1424	The Enormous Crocodile	4	He licked his lips.	157
1425	The Enormous Crocodile	6	He began to dribble with excitement.	158
1426	The Enormous Crocodile	9	& - Suddenly there was a tremendous whooshing noise.	159
1427	The Enormous Crocodile	5	It was Humpy-Rumpy, the Hippopotamus.	160
1428	The Enormous Crocodile	10	He came crashing and snorting out of the jung le.	161
1429	The Enormous Crocodile	13	His head was down low and he was galloping at a terrific speed.	162
1430	The Enormous Crocodile	5	"""Look out, Toto!” shouted Humpy-Rumpy."	163
1431	The Enormous Crocodile	3	"""Look out, Mary!"	164
1432	The Enormous Crocodile	6	That’s not a co conut tree!	165
1433	The Enormous Crocodile	11	It’s the Enormous Crocodile and he wants to eat you up!”	166
1434	The Enormous Crocodile	7	Humpy-Rumpy charged straight at the Enormous Crocodile.	167
1435	The Enormous Crocodile	16	He caught him with his giant head and sent him tumbling and skidding over the ground.	168
1436	The Enormous Crocodile	4	"""Ow-eeee!” cried the Crocodile."	169
1437	The Enormous Crocodile	1	"""Help!"	170
1438	The Enormous Crocodile	1	Stop!	171
1439	The Enormous Crocodile	3	Where am I?”	172
1440	The Enormous Crocodile	13	Toto and Mary ran back to the town as fast as they could.	173
1441	The Enormous Crocodile	5	But croc odiles are tough.	174
1442	The Enormous Crocodile	10	It is difficult for even a Hippopotamus to hurt them.	175
1443	The Enormous Crocodile	16	The Enormous Crocodile picked himself up and crept towards the place where the children’s playground was.	176
1444	The Enormous Crocodile	7	"""Now for Clever Trick Num ber Two!”"	177
1445	The Enormous Crocodile	4	he said to himself.	178
1446	The Enormous Crocodile	6	"""This one is certain to work!”"	179
1447	The Enormous Crocodile	11	There were no c hildren in the playground at that moment.	180
1448	The Enormous Crocodile	5	They were all in school.	181
1449	The Enormous Crocodile	18	The Enormous Crocodile found a large piece of wood and placed it in the middle of the playground.	182
1450	The Enormous Crocodile	23	Then he lay across the piece of wood an d tucked in his feet so that he looked almost exactly like a see-saw.	183
1451	The Enormous Crocodile	14	When sch ool was over, the children all came running on to the playground.	184
1452	The Enormous Crocodile	2	"""Oh look!”"	185
1453	The Enormous Crocodile	2	they cried.	186
1454	The Enormous Crocodile	5	'’We’ve got a new see-saw!”	187
1455	The Enormous Crocodile	8	They all crowded round, sh outing with excitement.	188
1456	The Enormous Crocodile	6	"""Bags I have the first go!”"	189
1457	The Enormous Crocodile	6	"""I’ll get on the other end!”"	190
1458	The Enormous Crocodile	5	"""I want to go first!”"	191
1459	The Enormous Crocodile	3	"""So do I!"	192
1460	The Enormous Crocodile	3	So do I!”	193
1461	The Enormous Crocodile	22	"Then, a girl who was older than the others said, ""It’s rather a funny knob bly sort of a see-saw, isn’t it?"	194
1462	The Enormous Crocodile	9	Do you think it’ll be safe to sit on?”	195
1463	The Enormous Crocodile	4	"""Of course it will!”"	196
1464	The Enormous Crocodile	3	the others said.	197
1465	The Enormous Crocodile	5	"""It looks strong as anything!”"	198
1466	The Enormous Crocodile	19	The Enormous Crocodile opened one eye just a tiny bit and watched the children who were crowding around him.	199
1467	The Enormous Crocodile	29	Soon, he thought, one of them is going to sit on my head, then I will give a jerk and a snap, and after that it will be yum	200
1468	The Enormous Crocodile	1	yum	201
1469	The Enormous Crocodile	1	yum.	202
1470	The Enormous Crocodile	27	At that moment, there was a flash of brown and som ething jumped into the playground and hopped up on to the to p of the swings.	203
1471	The Enormous Crocodile	5	It was Muggle-Wump, the Monkey.	204
1472	The Enormous Crocodile	1	"""Run!”"	205
1473	The Enormous Crocodile	5	Muggle-Wump shouted to the children.	206
1474	The Enormous Crocodile	6	"""All of you, run, run, run!"	207
1475	The Enormous Crocodile	4	That’s not a see-saw!	208
1476	The Enormous Crocodile	12	It’s the Enormous Crocod ile and he wants to eat you up!”	209
1477	The Enormous Crocodile	8	The children screamed and ran for their lives.	210
1478	The Enormous Crocodile	18	Muggle-Wump disappeared back into the ju ngle, and the Enormous Crocodile was left all alone in the playground.	211
1479	The Enormous Crocodile	12	He cursed the Monkey and waddled back into the bushes to hide.	212
1480	The Enormous Crocodile	6	"""I’m getting hungrier a nd hungrier!”"	213
1481	The Enormous Crocodile	2	he said.	214
1482	The Enormous Crocodile	15	"""I shall have to eat at least four children now before I am full up!”"	215
1483	The Enormous Crocodile	18	The E normous Crocodile crept around the edge of the town, taking great care not to be seen.	216
1484	The Enormous Crocodile	14	He came to a place where they were getting ready to have a fair.	217
1485	The Enormous Crocodile	14	There were slides and swings and do dgem-cars and people selling popcorn and candy-floss.	218
1486	The Enormous Crocodile	6	There was also a big roundabout.	219
1487	The Enormous Crocodile	12	The roundabout had marvellous wooden creatures for the children to ride on.	220
1488	The Enormous Crocodile	25	There were white horses and lions and tigers and mermaids w ith fishes’ tails and fearsome dragons with red tongues sticking out of their mouths.	221
1489	The Enormous Crocodile	13	"""Now for Clever Trick Number Three,” said the Enormous Crocodile, licking his lips."	222
1490	The Enormous Crocodile	23	When no one was looking, he crept up on to the roundabout and put himself between a wooden lion and a fearsome dragon.	223
1491	The Enormous Crocodile	10	He sat up a bit on his back le gs	224
1492	The Enormous Crocodile	5	and he kept very still.	225
1493	The Enormous Crocodile	10	He looked exactly like a wooden crocodile on the roundabout.	226
1494	The Enormous Crocodile	11	Soon, all sorts of children came flo cking into the fair.	227
1495	The Enormous Crocodile	7	Several of them ran towards the roundabout.	228
1496	The Enormous Crocodile	4	They were very excited.	229
1497	The Enormous Crocodile	9	"""I’m going to ride on a dragon!” cried one."	230
1498	The Enormous Crocodile	7	"""I’m going on a lovely white horse!”"	231
1499	The Enormous Crocodile	3	cri ed another.	232
1500	The Enormous Crocodile	9	"""I’m going on a lion!” cried a third one."	233
1501	The Enormous Crocodile	20	"And one little girl, whose name wa s Jill said, ""I’m going to ride on that funny old wooden crocodile!”"	234
1502	The Enormous Crocodile	16	The Enormous Crocodile kept very still, but he could see the little girl coming towards him.	235
1503	The Enormous Crocodile	4	"""Y ummy-yum-yum,” he thought."	236
1504	The Enormous Crocodile	8	"""I’ll gulp her up easily in one gollop.”"	237
1505	The Enormous Crocodile	19	Suddenly there was a swish and a swoosh and something came swishing and swooshing out of the sky .	238
1506	The Enormous Crocodile	5	It was the Roly-Poly Bird.	239
1507	The Enormous Crocodile	12	"He flew round and round the roundabout, singing, ""L ook out, Jill!"	240
1508	The Enormous Crocodile	2	Look out!	241
1509	The Enormous Crocodile	2	Look out!	242
1510	The Enormous Crocodile	6	Don ’t ride on that crocodile!”	243
1511	The Enormous Crocodile	5	Jill stopped and looked up.	244
1512	The Enormous Crocodile	9	"""That’s not a wooden crocodile!” sang the Roly-Poly Bird."	245
1513	The Enormous Crocodile	4	"""It’s a real one!"	246
1514	The Enormous Crocodile	14	It’s the Enormous Crocodile from the river and he wants to eat you up!”	247
1515	The Enormous Crocodile	4	Jill turned and ran.	248
1516	The Enormous Crocodile	6	So did all the other children.	249
1517	The Enormous Crocodile	20	Even the man who w as working the roundabout jumped off it and ran away as fast as he could.	250
1518	The Enormous Crocodile	16	The Enormous Croc odile cursed the Roly-Poly Bird and waddled back into the bushes to hide.	251
1519	The Enormous Crocodile	19	"""I’m so h ungry now,” he said to himself, ""I could eat six children before I am full up!”"	252
1520	The Enormous Crocodile	17	Just outside the town, there was a pretty little field with trees and bushes all round it.	253
1521	The Enormous Crocodile	6	This was called The Picnic Place.	254
1522	The Enormous Crocodile	23	There were several wooden tables and long benche s, and people were allowed to go there and have a picnic at any time.	255
1523	The Enormous Crocodile	10	The Enormous Cr ocodile crept over to The Picnic Place.	256
1524	The Enormous Crocodile	6	There was no one in sight.	257
1525	The Enormous Crocodile	6	"""Now for Clever Trick Number Four!”"	258
1526	The Enormous Crocodile	4	he whispered to himself.	259
1527	The Enormous Crocodile	16	He p icked a lovely bunch of flowers and arranged it on one of the tables.	260
1528	The Enormous Crocodile	18	From the sa me table, he took away one of the benches and hid it in the bushes.	261
1529	The Enormous Crocodile	12	Then he put himself in the place where the bench had been.	262
1530	The Enormous Crocodile	29	By tucking his head under his chest, and by twisting his tail out of sight, he made himself look very much like a long wooden bench with four legs.	263
1531	The Enormous Crocodile	12	Soon, two boys and two girls came along carrying baskets of food.	264
1532	The Enormous Crocodile	21	They were all from one family, an d their mother had said they could go out and have a picnic together.	265
1533	The Enormous Crocodile	8	"""Which table shall we sit at?” said one."	266
1534	The Enormous Crocodile	12	"""Let’s take the table with the lovely flowers on it,” said another."	267
1535	The Enormous Crocodile	9	The Enormous Crocodile kept as quiet as a mouse.	268
1536	The Enormous Crocodile	9	"""I shall eat them all,” he said to himself."	269
1537	The Enormous Crocodile	25	"""They will come and sit on my back and I will swizzle my h ead around quickly, and after that it’ll be squish crunch gollop.”"	270
1538	The Enormous Crocodile	12	"Suddenly a big deep voice from the jungle shouted, ""Stand back, children!"	271
1539	The Enormous Crocodile	2	Stand back!	272
1540	The Enormous Crocodile	2	Stand back!”	273
1541	The Enormous Crocodile	15	The childre n stopped and stared at the place where the voice was coming from.	274
1542	The Enormous Crocodile	16	Then, with a crashing o f branches, Trunky the Elephant came rushing out of the jungle.	275
1543	The Enormous Crocodile	10	"""That’s not a bench you were going to sit on!”"	276
1544	The Enormous Crocodile	3	he bello wed.	277
1545	The Enormous Crocodile	12	"""It’s the Enormous Crocodile, and he wants to eat you all up!”"	278
1546	The Enormous Crocodile	33	Trunky trotted over to the spot where the Enormous Crocodile was standing, and quick as a flash he wrapped his tr unk around the Crocodile’s tail and hoisted him up into the air.	279
1547	The Enormous Crocodile	15	"""Hey! Let me go!” yelled the Enormous Croc odile, who was now dangling upside down."	280
1548	The Enormous Crocodile	3	"""Let me go!"	281
1549	The Enormous Crocodile	3	Let me go!”	282
1550	The Enormous Crocodile	3	"""No,” Trunky said."	283
1551	The Enormous Crocodile	7	"""I will n ot let you go."	284
1552	The Enormous Crocodile	9	We’ve all had quite enough of your clever tricks.”	285
1553	The Enormous Crocodile	12	Trunky began to swing the Crocodile round and round in the air.	286
1554	The Enormous Crocodile	6	At first he swung him slowly.	287
1555	The Enormous Crocodile	6	Then he swung h im faster..	288
1556	The Enormous Crocodile	3	And FASTER ...	289
1557	The Enormous Crocodile	3	And FASTER ...	290
1558	The Enormous Crocodile	3	And FASTER STILL...	291
1559	The Enormous Crocodile	15	Soon the Enormous Crocodile was just a blurry circle going round and round Trunky’s head.	292
1560	The Enormous Crocodile	24	Suddenly, Trunky let go of the Crocodile’s tail, and the Crocod ile went shooting high up into the sky like a huge green rocket.	293
1561	The Enormous Crocodile	5	Up and up he went...	294
1562	The Enormous Crocodile	5	Higher and higher . ..	295
1563	The Enormous Crocodile	4	Faster and faster ...	296
1564	The Enormous Crocodile	19	He was going so fast and so high that soon the earth was just a tiny dot miles below.	297
1565	The Enormous Crocodile	5	He whizzed on and on.	298
1566	The Enormous Crocodile	5	He whizzed far into space.	299
1567	The Enormous Crocodile	5	He whizzed past the moon.	300
1568	The Enormous Crocodile	6	He whizzed past stars and planets.	301
1569	The Enormous Crocodile	3	Until at last....	302
1570	The Enormous Crocodile	15	With the most tremendous BANG the Enormous Crocodile crashed headfirst into the hot hot sun.	303
1571	The Enormous Crocodile	8	And he was sizzled up like a sausage!	304
1572	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	14	It was a long drive to the safari park but it was worth it.	0
1573	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	7	Apatosaurus saw an animal just like Triceratops.	1
1574	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	5	“That’s a rhinoceros,” said Hany.	2
1575	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	5	“Triceratops has got more horns.”	3
1576	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	10	Mum liked the giraffes best and Nan- liked the zebras.	4
1577	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	12	The monkeys were funny but the man said not to feed them.	5
1578	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	16	Sam asked him if they had pandas but the man said no, they were endangered animals.	6
1579	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	7	Harry wanted to know what endangered meant.	7
1580	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	8	Sam said he was too little to understand.	8
1581	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	2	Nan helped.	9
1582	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	8	She bought Harry a book about endangered animals.	10
1583	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	9	She thought it was sad about the Sumatran tigers.	11
1584	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	15	People kept hunting them so there were only a few left in the whole world.	12
1585	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	10	Harry really wanted to help but he had no money.	13
1586	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	8	“I want to save some animals,” he said.	14
1587	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	5	“What can I do, Mum?”	15
1588	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	3	Sam said, “Tuh!	16
1589	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	5	What a waste of time!”	17
1590	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	11	She said he was miles too small to make any difference.	18
1591	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	11	That’s why Harry made her do a smudge with her lipstick.	19
1592	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	7	Mum took Harry off to settle down.	20
1593	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	12	Then they looked on the Internet and found lots of endangered animals.	21
1594	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	7	Mum said why not do a poster?	22
1595	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	8	Harry could put it up in his window.	23
1596	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	9	Then maybe other people would help the animals too.	24
1597	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	4	Harry liked that idea.	25
1598	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	8	He got out his drawing stuff straight away.	26
1599	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	12	Trouble was, it was hard to know which animal to save first.	27
1600	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	4	The dinosaurs said, “Raaaah!	28
1601	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	7	We want to save some BIG animals!”	29
1602	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	4	So they started drawing.	30
1603	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	5	Tyrannosaurus did a polar bear.	31
1604	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	9	Pterodactyl asked Harry to help him do a gorilla.	32
1605	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	9	“Wait till I’ve finished my blue whale,” said Harry.	33
1606	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	13	“Blue whales are bigger than trains, bigger than dinosaurs, bigger than thirty-two elephants!”	34
1607	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	5	Stegosaurus did an army tank.	35
1608	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	7	“Army tanks don’t need saving!” said Triceratops.	36
1609	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	5	“Do a tree frog instead.”	37
1610	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	6	Mum said the drawings were excellent.	38
1611	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	6	She helped put the words on.	39
1612	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	5	LETS SAVE THESE ENDANGERED ANIMALS!	40
1613	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	8	Nan said, “Why not talk to Mr Bopsom?	41
1614	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	10	He might put up a poster in his shop window!	42
1615	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	10	Then people can see the pictures when they go shopping!”	43
1616	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	18	Mr Bopsom loved the pictures but he thought they might be a bit too small for a poster.	44
1617	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	9	He asked Harry if he could draw them bigger.	45
1618	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	10	Harry said no, sorry, his pictures always came out small.	46
1619	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	6	“That’s a shame,” said Mr Bopsom.	47
1620	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	5	“Because saving animals is important!”	48
1621	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	2	Poor Harry.	49
1622	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	8	He went home feeling maybe Sam was right.	50
1623	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	12	Maybe you had to be big before you could be any use.	51
1624	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	10	The very next day, Mr Bopsom was on the phone.	52
1625	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	1	....	53
1626	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	4	“I’ve had an idea!”	54
1627	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	2	he said.	55
1628	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	7	“Can you do me lots more pictures?”	56
1629	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	16	So Harry and the dinosaurs did more birds and bugs and reptiles and lots more dinosaurs!	57
1630	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	12	When Harry went into the shop two weeks later he was amazed!	58
1631	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	9	Mr Bopsom had made all the drawings into cards.	59
1632	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	18	He said that every time somebody bought a card, some of the money went to save endangered animals.	60
1633	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	3	Everybody loved them.	61
1634	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	3	They said, “Marvellous!”	62
1635	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	4	“What a brilliant idea!”	63
1636	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	2	“So original!”	64
1637	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	5	“Four cards for me, please!”	65
1638	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	10	The lady from the paper came and was very impressed.	66
1639	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	6	“What a wonderful thing you’ve done!”	67
1640	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	2	she said.	68
1641	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	3	“Raahh!” said Apatosaurus.	69
1642	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	6	“Save the strawberry poison arrow frog!”	70
1643	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	3	“Raahh!” said Pterodactyl.	71
1644	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	6	“Save the teeny blue tongued skink!”	72
1645	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	7	And Harry said, “Quite right, my dinosaurs!	73
1646	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	27	Because even if you are as tiny as a tick on the tail of a green turtle, you can still do something that makes a BIG difference.”	74
1647	Harry and the Dinosaurs Go Wild	1	ENDOSAURUS	75

1683	Open Very Carefully, A Book With Bite!	7	All that drawing has woken him up!	35

1691	Open Very Carefully, A Book With Bite!	9	Maybe if you shake the book, he’ll fall out.	43
1692	Open Very Carefully, A Book With Bite!	1	Hmm.	44
1693	Open Very Carefully, A Book With Bite!	4	That didn’t work either.	45
1694	Open Very Carefully, A Book With Bite!	2	But look?	46
1695	Open Very Carefully, A Book With Bite!	6	He’s worked out what to do.	47
1696	Open Very Carefully, A Book With Bite!	7	He’s munching a hole through the page.	48
1697	Open Very Carefully, A Book With Bite!	5	And he is nearly out?	49
1698	Open Very Carefully, A Book With Bite!	3	Goodbye, Mr Crocodile!	50
1699	Open Very Carefully, A Book With Bite!	3	I wasn’t scared.	51
1700	Open Very Carefully, A Book With Bite!	2	Were you?	52
1701	Open Very Carefully, A Book With Bite!	7	I wonder where he’ll turn up next?	53
1702	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	12	It was Christmas morning and one last present sat beneath the tree.	0
1703	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	6	“I bet it’s mine!” giggled Esme.	1
1704	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	2	“No, mine!”	2
1705	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	2	whooped Bear.	3
1706	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	13	But as they reached for the red-wrapped gift, they noticed something HUGELY surprising.	4
1707	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	7	It wasn’t for either one of them.	5
1708	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	5	Not Esme . . .	6
1709	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	2	OR Bear!	7
1710	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	9	The tag read For Little Bunny Boo-Boo, Love Santa.	8
1711	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	18	“Well,” said Esme, “in all the busy Jumble-tumbleness of Christmas, somebody’s present has been mixed up with ours.”	9
1712	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	5	BUT WHAT SHOULD THEY DO?	10
1713	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	10	“Let’s open it!” said Bear, giving it a BEARISH sniff.	11
1714	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	5	Esme had a better idea.	12
1715	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	12	“Let’s find Little Bunny Boo-Boo and make sure she gets her gift!”	13
1716	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	14	So they pulled on their warm winter clothes and set off into the snow.	14
1717	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	11	They had not gone far when they came across a sign.	15
1718	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	12	FOR LITTLE BUNNY BOO-BOO’S HOUSE, FOLLOW THE TREACHEROUS PATH “The TREACHEROUS path!”	16
1719	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	2	gulped Bear.	17
1720	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	7	“I don’t like the sound of that!”	18
1721	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	12	“How TREACHEROUS can it be?” shrugged Esme, sure they’d both be fine.	19
1722	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	3	But, OH DEAR!	20
1723	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	6	The path was VERY treacherous indeed!	21
1724	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	10	With slippery bits… and slidey bits… and FALL-DOWN-ON- YOUR-BOTTOM bits!	22
1725	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	1	Bump!	23
1726	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	9	After much slip-sliding about, they came across another sign.	24
1727	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	10	FOR LITTLE BUNNY BOO-BOO’S HOUSE, WALK THROUGH THE HOWLING GALE!	25
1728	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	10	Bear looked worried, but Esme gave him a comforting pat.	26
1729	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	6	“How HOWLY can a gale be?”	27
1730	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	2	she said.	28
1731	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	16	But suddenly the wind picked up and blasted them full in the face . . .	29
1732	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	1	Aroooooo!	30
1733	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	1	Arooooo!	31
1734	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	13	“Can’t we just keep Bunny Boo-Boo’s present and go back home?” begged Bear.	32
1735	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	10	“Of course not!” called Esme over the GROWLING- HOWLING GALE.	33
1736	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	14	Soon the wind died down, and they came to the last and final sign.	34
1737	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	12	Little Bunny Boo-Boo’S house is just beyond the DEEP, DEEP Snow drifts.	35
1738	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	1	WARNING:	36
1739	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	5	THEY REALLY ARE QUITE DEEP!	37
1740	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	26	When the snow reached Esme’s knees, Bear scooped her high up onto his shoulders and carried her, just like that, for the rest of the way.	38
1741	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	15	“Straight ahead for Bunny Boo-Boo’s house!” cheered Esme, as a twinkling cabin came into view.	39
1742	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	12	Well, when they reached the house, they could not have been happier.	40
1743	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	10	Firstly, Little Bunny Boo-Boo seemed so pleased to see them.	41
1744	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	4	Secondly, it was COSY-WARM!	42
1745	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	19	And thirdly, when they looked around they saw that Little Bunny Boo-Boo had not received ONE SINGLE Christmas present.	43
1746	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	2	Poor thing!	44
1747	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	17	So Bear handed over the gift, and they all huddled round to see what could be inside.	45
1748	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	5	“Maybe it’s tiddlywinks!” smiled Esme.	46
1749	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	4	“Or peppermints!” beamed Bear.	47
1750	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	25	BUT imagine Esme and Bear’s surprise when Bunny Boo-Boo opened the gift and it was ABSOLUTELY EMPTY with NOTHING INSIDE AT ALL . . .	48
1751	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	3	, . .	49
1752	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	12	except for a teeny-tiny handwritten note, on the smallest scrap of paper.	50
1753	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	10	Dear Little Bunny-Boo, here is exactly what you asked for!	51
1754	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	18	Love, Santa x Little Bunny Boo-Boo stared at Esme and Bear and her eyes grew wide with joy.	52
1755	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	19	“I’ve just moved into my little cabin,” she said, “and I haven’t had time to make a single friend.	53
1756	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	11	So, this year, I asked Santa for a VERY special gift...	54
1757	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	34	“A friend (perhaps even two) who was honest and true, who would walk a TREACHEROUS PATH, battle the HOWLIEST of GALES, and brave the DEEPEST OF SNOW DRIFTS just to stand by my side.”	55
1758	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	11	“So you see!” smiled Bunny Boo-Boo, “Santa’s present to me ...	56
1759	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	2	IS YOU!”	57
1760	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	18	“US?” said Esme and Bear, thinking that perhaps a skipping rope or spinning top might have been better!	58
1761	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	33	But after they’d enjoyed a Christmas Day full of laughter and lovely things to eat, they all agreed that things like skipping ropes and spinning tops were very nice but . . .	59
1762	The Most Wonderful Gift In The World	15	a TRUE friend (perhaps even two) was the BEST and MOST WONDERFUL gift of all!	60
1763	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	7	Elmer, the patchwork elephant, was picking fruit.	0
1764	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	6	“Picking fruit, Elmer?” asked a monkey.	1
1765	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	13	“I’m going to see Grandpa Eldo and this is his favourite,” said Elmer.	2
1766	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	5	“Golden Grandpa Eldo,” said Monkey.	3
1767	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	2	“That’s nice.”	4
1768	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	7	Grandpa Eldo was pleased to see Elmer....	5
1769	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	6	“What a lovely surprise,” he said.	6
1770	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	6	“What’s that balanced on your head?”	7
1771	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	5	“Your favourite fruit,” said Elmer.	8
1772	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	6	“Fancy you remembering that,” said Eldo.	9
1773	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	7	“I remember lots of things,” said Elmer.	10
1774	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	7	"""What else do you remember?” asked Eldo."	11
1775	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	9	“The walks we used to go on,” said Elmer.	12
1776	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	1	“Walks?	13
1777	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	4	Where did we go?”	14
1778	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	2	Eldo asked.	15
1779	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	5	“Don’t you remember?” said Elmer.	16
1780	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	3	“I’ll show you.	17
1781	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	2	Come on.”	18
1782	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	11	“We used to come this way, past the rocks,” said Elmer.	19
1783	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	10	“Here I used to hide, then jump out and shout...”	20
1784	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	7	Elmer turned around, but Eldo wasn’t there.	21
1785	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	1	“Grandpa?	22
1786	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	5	Grandpa Eldo, where are you?”	23
1787	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	2	he called.	24
1788	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	8	Eldo suddenly jumped out in front of Elmer.	25
1789	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	1	“BOO!”	26
1790	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	2	he shouted.	27
1791	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	2	“Oh, Grandpa!”	28
1792	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	2	Elmer laughed.	29
1793	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	6	“I was supposed to do that.	30
1794	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	9	Come on, now we go down to the stream.”	31
1795	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	9	At the stream Elmer said, “Don’t you remember anything?	32
1796	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	6	We used to play stepping stones.”	33
1797	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	4	“Show me,” said Eldo.	34
1798	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	8	There were already some rocks in the water.	35
1799	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	8	Elmer added more to fill in the spaces.	36
1800	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	5	“Now walk across,” he said.	37
1801	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	7	“Be careful, there’s usually a wobbly one.”	38
1802	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	6	Suddenly there was a huge SPLASH!	39
1803	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	4	Elmer had fallen in.	40
1804	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	3	“You were right.	41
1805	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	6	You’ve a good memory,” Eldo chuckled.	42
1806	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	2	Elmer laughed.	43
1807	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	4	“Lucky it’s not deep.”	44
1808	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	4	“Now where?” asked Eldo.	45
1809	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	6	“You still don’t remember,” said Elmer.	46
1810	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	5	“To the lake, of course.”	47
1811	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	9	“We used to play Ducks and Drakes,” said Elmer.	48
1812	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	13	He picked up a flat stone and sent it skipping across the water.	49
1813	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	4	“Seven splashes,” he said.	50
1814	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	5	“Let me try,” said Eldo.	51
1815	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	13	“You need a nice flat stone,” said Elmer, but Eldo had already thrown.	52
1816	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	11	“1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,” they counted together.	53
1817	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	9	When they set off again, Elmer started to sing.	54
1818	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	9	Eldo joined in, then the birds joined in too.	55
1819	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	10	“When we’re marching on our way, bumpity bump, bumpity bump.	56
1820	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	10	We like to laugh and play, bumpity bump, bumpity bump.	57
1821	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	15	And when we can’t think what to do we simply hide and then shout, ‘BOOOOO!’	58
1822	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	10	When we’re marching on our way, bumpity bump, bumpity bump!”	59
1823	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	4	When they shouted, “BOO!”	60
1824	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	7	the birds flew around, squawking with laughter.	61
1825	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	12	It started to rain and they dashed into a cave for shelter.	62
1826	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	10	"""Surely you remember the stories you used to tell me?”"	63
1827	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	2	Elmer asked.	64
1828	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	2	Eldo frowned.	65
1829	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	5	"""What were they?” he asked."	66
1830	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	12	“Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk, Cinderella, Three Little Pigs ...	67
1831	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	2	Mmmm ...	68
1832	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	3	Billygoats Gruff, ..	69
1833	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	2	Aaaah ...	70
1834	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	2	Sleeping Beauty...”	71
1835	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	2	Elmer hesitated.	72
1836	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	7	“Hansel and Gretel, Tom Thumb, Goldilocks ...”	73
1837	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	2	Eldo continued.	74
1838	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	17	"""You cheat, you do remember!” said Elmer. Eldo laughed and, now the rain had stopped, ran off."	75
1839	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	14	Elmer chased him all the way back to Eldo’s place, shouting, “You tricked me.	76
1840	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	3	You remembered everything.	77
1841	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	5	I’ll get you, Grandpa Eldo.”	78
1842	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	22	After they had their breath back, and stopped laughing, and finished the fruit that Elmer brought, it was time to go home.	79
1843	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	6	"""It’s been fun, Grandpa,” said Elmer."	80
1844	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	6	"""You really remembered everything, didn’t you?”"	81
1845	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	12	"""Yes,” chuckled Eldo, ""and I was so happy that you did, too."	82
1846	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	9	But best of all, you remembered to visit me.”	83
1847	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	2	Elmer smiled.	84
1848	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	4	"""’Bye, Grandpa,” he said."	85
1849	Elmer and Grandpa Eldo	3	"""See you soon.”"	86

1852	Tabby McTat	10	MEEE-EW and the old guitar, How PURRRR-fectly happy we are.”	2
1853	Tabby McTat	31	One morning, while Fred ate some bacon and bread, McTat took a stroll round the block, Then stopped — for there on a doorstep sat a gorgeously glossy and green-eyed cat.	3
1854	Tabby McTat	8	She was black with one snowy white sock.	4
1855	Tabby McTat	7	Sock and McTat had a cat-to-cat chat	5
1856	Tabby McTat	19	And that’s how their story began, For while they were chatting of this and of that . . .	6
1857	Tabby McTat	10	A thief had his eye on the old checked hat.	7
1858	Tabby McTat	3	He eyed it.	8
1859	Tabby McTat	3	He snatched it.	9
1860	Tabby McTat	2	He ran!	10
1861	Tabby McTat	12	The Busker gave chase but he tripped on a lace And crash!	11
1862	Tabby McTat	6	In a flash he was down.	12
1863	Tabby McTat	9	He broke his leg and he banged his head.	13
1864	Tabby McTat	14	And he ended up in a hospital bed In a faraway part of town.	14
1865	Tabby McTat	3	“Goodbye,” McTat said.	15
1866	Tabby McTat	6	“I must get back to Fred.”	16
1867	Tabby McTat	6	But where had the busker gone?	17
1868	Tabby McTat	9	The sun went down and the sky grew black.	18
1869	Tabby McTat	9	The stars came out, hut he didn’t come hack.	19
1870	Tabby McTat	6	McTat lingered on . . .	20
1871	Tabby McTat	2	and on.	21
1872	Tabby McTat	17	A week later, Sock took a stroll round the block And found her new friend looking thin.	22
1873	Tabby McTat	9	“He’s gone off and left me!’' said Tabby McTat.	23
1874	Tabby McTat	17	Then Sock said, “My people, Prunella and Pat, Would gladly find room for a fine tabby cat.”	24
1875	Tabby McTat	8	She was right and they took McTat in.	25
1876	Tabby McTat	16	Next morning, old Fred left his hospital bed And found his way back to the square.	26
1877	Tabby McTat	10	But a brass hand stood where the pair once sat.	27
1878	Tabby McTat	24	And the hand played this and the band played that, And Fred looked all round for his loud-miaowed cat, But Tabby McTat wasn’t there!	28
1879	Tabby McTat	71	Now McTat had a wife and a very full life With plenty of Things To Do, Like washing Prunella and pouncing on Pat, And hiding the car keys under the mat, And keeping the newspapers nice and flat, And giving the pens a n occasional bat, And nibbling this and nibbling that, But he dreamed of his friend with the old checked hat And always woke up with a mew -	29
1880	Tabby McTat	8	And often he said, “What’s happened to Fred?”	30
1881	Tabby McTat	9	And his paws took him hack to the square.	31
1882	Tabby McTat	19	But a conjuror stood where, the pair once sat, And he pulled out this… and he pulled out that...	32
1883	Tabby McTat	15	And people threw coins in the tall black hat, But the busker was never there.	33
1884	Tabby McTat	15	One morning Sock said, “Look under the bed And see the three kittens I’ve had!”	34
1885	Tabby McTat	23	And Soames looked like this, and Susan like that, And the littlest kitten, called Samuel Sprat, Looked exactly the same as his dad.	35
1886	Tabby McTat	10	The three kittens grew and they learnt how to mew.	36
1887	Tabby McTat	7	And McTat sometimes sang them his song.	37
1888	Tabby McTat	16	And Samuel Sprat with his tabby-grey fur had a deafening miaow and a very loud purr.	38
1889	Tabby McTat	18	And he simply loved singing along: “Me, you and the old guitar, How perfectly, perfectly happy we are.	39
1890	Tabby McTat	10	MEEE-EW and the old guitar, How PURRRR-fectly happy we are.	40
1891	Tabby McTat	8	When Susan and Soames found very good homes.	41
1892	Tabby McTat	6	Their parents were happy and proud.	42
1893	Tabby McTat	13	There was one home like this… and another like that . . .	43
1894	Tabby McTat	6	But nobody wanted poor Samuel Sprat.	44
1895	Tabby McTat	8	They all said, “His voice is too loud.”	45
1896	Tabby McTat	7	Now Tabby McTat was a home-loving cat.	46
1897	Tabby McTat	7	But be couldn’t stop dreaming of Fred.	47
1898	Tabby McTat	23	And one day be called for his wife and his son And be told them, “There’ s something that has to be done.	48
1899	Tabby McTat	8	I must go and find him,” he said.	49
1900	Tabby McTat	7	So up and down . . .	50
1901	Tabby McTat	7	and all over town . . .	51
1902	Tabby McTat	33	He wandered a whole week long, For many a morning and afternoon, By the light of the sun, and the light of the moon, Till he heard a familiar song . . .	52
1903	Tabby McTat	6	“Just me and the old guitar.	53
1904	Tabby McTat	9	If I had a cat I’d be happier far.	54
1905	Tabby McTat	6	Just me and the old guitar.	55
1906	Tabby McTat	10	With my cat I’d he happier far” “It’s Tabby McTat!	56
1907	Tabby McTat	4	It’s my long-lost cat!”	57
1908	Tabby McTat	5	Old Fred was ecstatically glad.	58
1909	Tabby McTat	19	Then the two of them sang of this and that, And people threw coins in the new checked hat….	59
1910	Tabby McTat	6	But why did McTat feel sad?	60
1911	Tabby McTat	45	He was missing his wife and his comfortable life And the dozens of Things To Do, (Like washing Prunella and pouncing on Pat, And hiding the car keys under the mat, And keeping the newspapers nice and flat, And giving the pens an occasional bat.)	61
1912	Tabby McTat	8	But how could he tell the busker that?	62
1913	Tabby McTat	8	Then out from a shadow sprang Samuel Sprat.	63
1914	Tabby McTat	8	"“Oh please let ME be the busker’s cat!"""	64
1915	Tabby McTat	8	He said with his deafening mew. ,o C	65
1916	Tabby McTat	15	Now Samuel Sprat is the busker’s cat with a miaow that is loud and strong.	66
1917	Tabby McTat	28	The two of them sing of this and that (though Samuel sings just a little bit flat), And people throw coins in the old checked hat, (M 2	67
1918	Tabby McTat	18	And this is their favourite song: “Me, you and the old guitar, How perfectly, perfectly happy we are.	68
1919	Tabby McTat	11	MEEE-EW and the old guitar, How PURRRR-fectly happy we are. ”	69
1920	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	9	Sam wanted Mum to take her to the museum.	0
1921	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	8	She had to study the Romans for homework.	1
1922	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	5	“What are Romans?” asked Harry.	2
1923	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	13	Sam said they were our ancestors, but he was too young to understand.	3
1924	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	9	Harry wanted to take the dinosaurs to see them.	4
1925	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	4	Sam said, “No way!”	5
1926	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	9	She said Harry would just get bored and silly.	6
1927	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	13	That was why Sam’s homework got smudged Mum made them both settle down.	7
1928	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	11	She said a museum would be a fine outing for everybody.	8
1929	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	6	“I’d love to go,” said Nan.	9
1930	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	7	The museum was bigger than a hospital.	10
1931	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	6	You had to have a map.	11
1932	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	10	On the way to the Romans, they passed the cavemen.	12
1933	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	5	“Are these ancestors?” asked Harry.	13
1934	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	10	Mum said yes, everybody in the world came from cavemen.	14
1935	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	6	They lit fires and did hunting.	15
1936	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	5	Harry liked the stone axes!	16

1941	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	10	They saw mummies in boxes and funny writing like pictures.	21
1942	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	5	“Are Egyptians ancestors?” asked Harry.	22
1943	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	8	“Yes, but not the right ones,” said Sam.	23
1944	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	4	“We want the Romans.	24
1945	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	4	Come on, hurry up!”	25
1946	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	5	Finally they reached the Romans.	26
1947	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	11	They had good swords and spears, and helmets with brushes on.	27
1948	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	10	But what a lot of old pots, broken ones too!	28
1949	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	4	Sam started doing drawing.	29
1950	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	7	“We’ve seen the Romans now,” said Harry.	30
1951	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	2	“I’m hungry!	31
1952	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	2	Let’s go!”	32
1953	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	1	“Raaah!	33
1954	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	5	Anchisaurus pinched me!” said Stegosaurus.	34
1955	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	8	“He’s taking up all the room!” said Anchisaurus.	35
1956	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	7	“Behave!” said Harry in a loud voice.	36
1957	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	7	“Look, Harry is being silly!” groaned Sam.	37
1958	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	3	“I knew it!”	38
1959	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	10	“I think the dinosaurs need a run about,” said Harry.	39
1960	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	4	Mum said better not.	40
1961	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	4	They might get lost.	41
1962	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	9	“Come on, let’s get something to eat,” she said.	42
1963	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	11	“Afterwards we’ll come back here, so Sam can finish her studies.”	43
1964	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	5	The cafeteria was very busy.	44
1965	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	18	Nan and Harry and the dinosaurs waited at a table while Mum and Sam went to queue up.	45
1966	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	4	“Look, I’m a caveman!	46
1967	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	3	Rahhh!” said Triceratops.	47
1968	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	4	“Look, I’m a Roman!	48
1969	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	3	Rahhh!” said Pterodactyl.	49
1970	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	4	“Look, I’m a mummy!	50
1971	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	3	Rahhh!” said Tyrannosaurus.	51
1972	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	15	After lunch, everyone felt a lot better and they set off back to the Romans.	52
1973	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	8	But it wasn't long before Anchisaurus got bored.	53
1974	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	5	“I’m bored too!” said Tyrannosaurus.	54
1975	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	10	‘Never mind,” said Harry, “it’s your turn to do studying.	55
1976	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	4	Pay attention, my dinosaurs.”	56
1977	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	7	He taught them Climbing Up Display Cases.	57
1978	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	8	Then taught them Sliding On The Slippery Floor.	58
1979	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	6	That was how they got lost.	59
1980	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	2	“Oh no!	60
1981	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	4	Where’s Harry?” said Mum.	61
1982	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	1	“Quick!	62
1983	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	6	Let’s find the person in charge!”	63
1984	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	5	Sam said Harry was stupid.	64
1985	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	8	“I bet he’s gone off on a bus!”	65
1986	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	2	she said.	66
1987	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	3	“Nonsense!” said Nan.	67
1988	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	6	“I know where we’ll find him!”	68
1989	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	7	They followed Nan to the prehistoric Hall.	69
1990	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	5	“There he is!” said Nan.	70
1991	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	3	“I knew it!”	71
1992	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	6	Harry was still teaching his dinosaurs.	72
1993	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	10	“Boys come from cavemen and Romans and Egyptians,” he explained.	73
1994	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	5	“But these are your ancestors.”	74
1995	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	7	So Tyrannosaurus said “Raaah!” to his ancestor.	75
1996	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	15	So did Apatosaurus and Scelidosaurs and Triceratops and the rest of the bucketful of dinosaurs.	76
1997	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	9	All except Pterodactyl, who gave his ancestor a nose-rub.	77
1998	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	8	“Now, young man!” said the person in charge.	78
1999	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	7	“We had better look for your mum.	79
2000	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	6	Could you tell me your name?”	80
2001	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	12	Harry said his name, address and telephone number, no problem at all.	81
2002	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	8	All the people said very good, clever boy!	82
2003	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	3	Nan rushed over.	83
2004	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	3	“He’s with us!”	84
2005	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	3	she called proudly.	85
2006	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	3	“Harry!” said Mum.	86
2007	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	5	“We thought we’d lost you!”	87
2008	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	5	“I wasn’t lost!” said Harry.	88
2009	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	5	“I was with my dinosaurs.”	89
2010	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	9	"“And we were with our ancestors,"" said the dinosaurs."	90
2011	Harry and the Dinosaurs at the Museum	1	“RAAAAH!”	91

2013	The Hedgehog's Balloon	13	Percy the park keeper looked up from his work and gazed in wonder.	0
2014	The Hedgehog's Balloon	5	“Two red ones. . .	1
2015	The Hedgehog's Balloon	4	a blue one. .	2
2016	The Hedgehog's Balloon	1	.	3
2017	The Hedgehog's Balloon	6	there’s a yellow one. . .	4
2018	The Hedgehog's Balloon	6	and another blue one. . .”	5
2019	The Hedgehog's Balloon	4	Percy was counting balloons.	6
2020	The Hedgehog's Balloon	10	“I wonder where they’re coming from,” he said to himself.	7
2021	The Hedgehog's Balloon	6	“Somebody must have had a party.”	8
2022	The Hedgehog's Balloon	9	He put down his trowel and wiped his hands.	9
2023	The Hedgehog's Balloon	12	“Well, if nobody wants them,” he said, “I think I’ll help myself.”	10
2024	The Hedgehog's Balloon	13	Percy chased after the balloons as they floated past him on the breeze.	11
2025	The Hedgehog's Balloon	13	It didn’t take him long to collect as many as he could carry.	12
2026	The Hedgehog's Balloon	10	He began to walk back towards his hut, whistling happily.	13
2027	The Hedgehog's Balloon	3	Suddenly, Percy stopped.	14
2028	The Hedgehog's Balloon	12	He could hear a faint sound coining from a tree stump nearby.	15
2029	The Hedgehog's Balloon	6	It was not a happy sound.	16
2030	The Hedgehog's Balloon	4	“Someone’s crying,” said Percy.	17
2031	The Hedgehog's Balloon	2	“Oh dear.”	18
2032	The Hedgehog's Balloon	12	He let go of his balloons and hurried over to the stump.	19
2033	The Hedgehog's Balloon	12	Sitting on the tree stump, and looking very upset, was a hedgehog.	20
2034	The Hedgehog's Balloon	9	Two mice were doing their best to comfort him.	21
2035	The Hedgehog's Balloon	4	“Goodness me,” said Percy.	22
2036	The Hedgehog's Balloon	4	“Whatever is the matter?”	23
2037	The Hedgehog's Balloon	7	“It’s all these balloons,” said the hedgehog.	24
2038	The Hedgehog's Balloon	16	Then, in between sniffs and sobs, he explained to Percy how he had always loved balloons.	25
2039	The Hedgehog's Balloon	17	The trouble was that he could never have them because they would always burst on his spines.	26
2040	The Hedgehog's Balloon	4	“It’s just not fair!”	27
2041	The Hedgehog's Balloon	7	And the hedgehog burst into tears again.	28
2042	The Hedgehog's Balloon	5	“You poor thing,” said Percy.	29
2043	The Hedgehog's Balloon	15	He tried to put his arm around the hedgehog but took it away at once.	30
2044	The Hedgehog's Balloon	3	“Ouch,” he said.	31
2045	The Hedgehog's Balloon	17	Then Percy took one of his thick gardening gloves out of his pocket and put it on.	32
2046	The Hedgehog's Balloon	6	The hedgehog nestled into his hand.	33
2047	The Hedgehog's Balloon	12	“I think everyone should be able to play with balloons,” said Percy.	34
2048	The Hedgehog's Balloon	4	“And that includes hedgehogs.”	35
2049	The Hedgehog's Balloon	16	He put on the other glove and gently carried the hedgehog towards an old store shed.	36
2050	The Hedgehog's Balloon	4	The two mice followed.	37
2051	The Hedgehog's Balloon	7	The mice watched Percy through the window.	38
2052	The Hedgehog's Balloon	17	He set the hedgehog down on a workbench and then he took a tin from a shelf.	39
2053	The Hedgehog's Balloon	4	He opened the lid.	40
2054	The Hedgehog's Balloon	8	“What’s Percy doing?” said one of the mice.	41
2055	The Hedgehog's Balloon	4	“What’s in that box?”	42
2056	The Hedgehog's Balloon	7	“I don’t know,” said the other mouse.	43
2057	The Hedgehog's Balloon	4	“I can’t see properly.”	44
2058	The Hedgehog's Balloon	10	The mice didn’t have to wait long to find out.	45
2059	The Hedgehog's Balloon	9	Percy picked up the hedgehog and brought him outside.	46
2060	The Hedgehog's Balloon	3	“There!” said Percy.	47
2061	The Hedgehog's Balloon	9	“A good idea, even if I say so myself!	48
2062	The Hedgehog's Balloon	8	I think those balloons will be safe now.”	49
2063	The Hedgehog's Balloon	7	The mice clapped and the hedgehog beamed.	50
2064	The Hedgehog's Balloon	10	He thought how smart he must look, wearing his corks.	51
2065	The Hedgehog's Balloon	8	Percy caught hold of a bright yellow balloon.	52
2066	The Hedgehog's Balloon	12	“Here you are,” said Percy as he handed it to the hedgehog.	53
2067	The Hedgehog's Balloon	4	“Your very first balloon.”	54
2068	The Hedgehog's Balloon	23	The hedgehog took the balloon and with a great big smile on his face, he scampered off with the balloon floating beside him.	55
2069	The Hedgehog's Balloon	9	“Another satisfied customer,” said Percy, feeling pleased with himself.	56
2070	The Hedgehog's Balloon	8	Percy turned to go back to his hut.	57
2071	The Hedgehog's Balloon	7	But suddenly, there came a loud BANG!	58
2072	The Hedgehog's Balloon	3	“Oops!” said Percy.	59
2073	The Hedgehog's Balloon	8	“One of the corks must have come off.	60
2074	The Hedgehog's Balloon	9	It’s a good job we’ve got plenty of balloons!”	61
2075	The Hedgehog's Balloon	9	“Don’t worry,” Percy called to the hedgehog, “I’m coming...”	62

2100	Jasper's Jungle Journey	3	Jasper ran home.	24
2101	Jasper's Jungle Journey	9	And when he got there, what did he see?	25

2103	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	12	“I don’t want to be a night bird,” Plop told his mummy.	0
2104	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	3	“Dark is nasty.”	1
2105	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	7	“You don’t know that,” said his mummy.	2
2106	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	11	“Go and ask that little boy down there what he thinks.”	3
2107	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	9	So Plop took a deep breath and flew down.	4
2108	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	5	Plop landed with a somersault.	5
2109	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	3	“Hello!” he said.	6
2110	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	8	“I’ve come to find out about the dark.”	7
2111	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	4	“Oh!” said the boy.	8
2112	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	5	“Dark is EXCITING, especially tonight.	9
2113	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	5	We’re going to have fireworks!”	10
2114	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	8	“Does it have to be dark?” asked Plop.	11
2115	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	5	“Of course!” replied the boy.	12
2116	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	8	“You can’t see the fireworks unless it’s dark.”	13
2117	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	9	“Well?” said Mrs Barn Owl when Plop arrived back.	14
2118	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	7	“He says dark is EXCITING,” said Plop.	15
2119	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	8	“I still do not like it AT ALL!	16
2120	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	12	But I will watch the fireworks if you will sit by me.”	17
2121	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	6	So that is what they did.	18
2122	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	21	When the last firework had faded away, Mr Barn Owl went hunting, until daylight came and it was time for bed.	19
2123	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	7	Halfway through the morning, Plop woke up.	20
2124	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	16	“Plop, dear,” said Mrs Barn Owl, “why don’t you find out some more about the dark?	21
2125	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	6	Go and ask that old lady.”	22
2126	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	5	Plop landed with a thump.	23
2127	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	3	“Hello!” he said.	24
2128	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	7	“I’ve come to ask about the dark.	25
2129	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	10	I want to go hunting with Daddy, but I’m frightened.”	26
2130	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	5	"""How odd,” said the lady."	27
2131	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	4	“I love the dark.	28
2132	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	20	Dark is KIND I can forget that I am old and I can sit and remember all the good times.”	29
2133	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	8	“I haven’t much to remember yet,” said Plop.	30
2134	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	5	“I’m rather new, you see.”	31
2135	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	8	“Well?” said his mummy, as Plop flew back.	32
2136	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	18	“The old lady says dark is KIND,” said Plop, “but I still do not like it AT ALL.”	33
2137	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	17	That evening, when both his parents went hunting, Plop closed his eyes and tried to remember something.	34
2138	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	6	Suddenly he heard a happy shout.	35
2139	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	13	He peered through the leaves and saw a boy sitting by a fire.	36
2140	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	8	Plop flew down, landing with an enormous thud.	37
2141	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	3	“Hello!” said Plop.	38
2142	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	3	“What’s going on?”	39
2143	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	7	“I’m guarding the camp-fire,” said the boy.	40
2144	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	10	“The others are playing games in the dark, lucky things.”	41
2145	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	7	“Do you like the dark?” asked Plop.	42
2146	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	2	“It’s super!”	43
2147	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	3	the boy replied.	44
2148	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	3	“Dark is FUN.	45
2149	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	5	Would you like to stay?”	46
2150	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	3	So Plop stayed.	47
2151	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	13	The boys sang round the fire until it was only a red glow.	48
2152	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	4	Then Plop flew home.	49
2153	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	4	“Well?” said his mummy.	50
2154	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	9	“I met a boy who says dark is FUN.	51
2155	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	8	I still do not like it AT ALL.	52
2156	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	5	But I like camp- fires!”	53
2157	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	14	Plop woke up the next afternoon and went out on to the landing branch.	54
2158	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	12	“Go and find out about the dark again,” said Mrs Barn Owl.	55
2159	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	10	“See what that little girl down there thinks about it.”	56
2160	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	5	Plop landed with a bounce.	57
2161	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	3	“Hello!” he said.	58
2162	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	5	“Do you like the dark?”	59
2163	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	2	“Of course!”	60
2164	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	4	the little girl replied.	61
2165	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	3	“Dark is NECESSARY.	62
2166	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	7	Without the dark, Father Christmas couldn’t come.	63
2167	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	8	You’d have an empty stocking on Christmas day.”	64
2168	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	7	“I don’t have a stocking,” said Plop.	65
2169	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	13	So the little girl took off her Wellington and gave him her sock.	66
2170	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	8	“Hang it up on Christmas Eve,” she said.	67
2171	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	4	“Thank you!” said Plop.	68
2172	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	5	“Well?” said Mrs Barn Owl.	69
2173	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	11	“She says dark is NECESSARY, because of Father Christmas,” Plop said.	70
2174	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	19	“I still do not like it AT ALL - but I will hang up this sock on Christmas Eve.”	71
2175	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	5	Plop slept nearly all day.	72
2176	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	6	By evening he was wide awake.	73
2177	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	4	“It’s getting-up time, Daddy!”	74
2178	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	2	he shouted.	75
2179	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	8	Mr Barn Owl looked up at the sky.	76
2180	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	6	“Not quite yet, Plop,” he said.	77
2181	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	4	“Wait till it’s dark.”	78
2182	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	13	That night, Plop saw a man standing on the ground below their tree.	79
2183	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	9	So he flew down, landing with a gentle bump.	80
2184	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	3	“Hello!” said Plop.	81
2185	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	2	“What’s that?”	82
2186	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	5	“A telescope,” said the man.	83
2187	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	9	“For looking at the stars and planets at night.”	84
2188	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	9	“I don’t like the dark very much,” said Plop.	85
2189	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	7	“But dark is WONDERFUL,” said the man.	86
2190	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	3	“I’ll show you!”	87
2191	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	14	He showed Plop lots of stars and how they made patterns in the sky.	88
2192	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	12	Plop said thank you and flew back to his mummy and daddy.	89
2193	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	9	“A man with a telescope showed me the stars!”	90
2194	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	3	Plop told them.	91
2195	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	5	“He says dark is WONDERFUL!”	92
2196	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	19	Plop had his supper in bed and then, like a real night bird, he slept right through the day.	93
2197	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	7	When Plop woke, it was almost dark.	94
2198	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	5	“Now who’s a day bird!”	95
2199	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	2	he shouted.	96
2200	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	6	Plop looked at his sleepy parents.	97
2201	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	9	He wasn’t going to hang about waiting for them.	98
2202	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	4	He might miss something.	99
2203	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	9	Plop floated down and landed like a soft feather.	100
2204	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	6	He saw a big black cat.	101
2205	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	4	“Hello!” said the cat.	102
2206	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	3	“I’m going exploring.	103
2207	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	5	Won’t you come with me?”	104
2208	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	12	‘ “I’d like to,” said Plop, “but I’m afraid of the dark.”	105
2209	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	7	“But dark is BEAUTIFUL,” said the cat.	106
2210	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	1	“Look!”	107
2211	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	2	Plop looked.	108
2212	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	4	The moon had risen.	109
2213	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	7	Everything was bathed in its white light.	110
2214	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	6	“Moonlight is magic,” said the cat.	111
2215	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	15	“Come with me and I will show you the night-time world of cats and owls.”	112
2216	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	8	The cat took Plop up to the rooftops.	113
2217	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	4	“This is my world!	114
2218	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	9	I am a night bird after all!” said Plop.	115
2219	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	5	“Thank you for showing me.	116
2220	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	10	I must go now and tell my mummy and daddy.”	117
2221	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	11	“Good night,” said the black cat, “and many, many Good Nights!”	118
2222	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	4	“Well?” said his mummy.	119
2223	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	5	Plop took a deep breath.	120
2224	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	7	“The small boy said dark is EXCITING.	121
2225	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	7	The old lady said dark is KIND.	122
2226	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	7	The camp-fire boy said dark is FUN.	123
2227	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	7	The little girl said dark is NECESSARY.	124
2228	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	16	The man with the telescope said dark is WONDERFUL and the cat said dark is BEAUTIFUL.”	125
2229	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	9	“And what do you think, Plop? asked his mummy.	126
2230	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	9	Plop looked up at his parents with twinkling eyes.	127
2231	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	6	“I think - dark is SUPER!”	128
2232	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	2	he said.	129
2233	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	25	Then Plop took off to go hunting in the dark, Mr and Mrs Barn Owl on each side and Plop in the middle ... …	130
2234	The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark	4	Plop, the night bird.	131
2235	The Cross Rabbit	7	It was a bright, cold winter’s day.	0
2236	The Cross Rabbit	19	Snow had fallen in the night and now everything in the park had been turned into a guessing game.	1
2237	The Cross Rabbit	15	“It looks wonderful,” said Percy the park keeper, “but it makes a lot of work.”	2
2238	The Cross Rabbit	12	Standing next to Percy was a rather old and cross looking rabbit.	3
2239	The Cross Rabbit	6	“Well, quite so,” said the rabbit.	4
2240	The Cross Rabbit	6	“But now, what about these mice?	5
2241	The Cross Rabbit	7	They’re making a dreadful nuisance of themselves.”	6
2242	The Cross Rabbit	2	: __	7
2243	The Cross Rabbit	17	Percy found it hard not to laugh when he saw what was making the rabbit so cross.	8
2244	The Cross Rabbit	6	The mice were having great fun.	9
2245	The Cross Rabbit	12	Percy began to chuckle, but quickly turned the chuckle into a cough.	10
2246	The Cross Rabbit	22	After all, this was no fun for an old rabbit who only wanted to curl up and sleep through the cold weather.	11
2247	The Cross Rabbit	8	I “Now come along, you mice,” said Percy.	12
2248	The Cross Rabbit	7	“You must go and play somewhere else.	13
2249	The Cross Rabbit	9	And,” he added, “try to stay out of mischief.”	14
2250	The Cross Rabbit	5	The mice looked very disappointed.	15
2251	The Cross Rabbit	9	Slowly they walked away, dragging their toboggans behind them.	16
2252	The Cross Rabbit	14	The old rabbit said thank you to Percy and then disappeared into his burrow.	17
2253	The Cross Rabbit	9	M. S Percy got on with clearing the snow.	18
2254	The Cross Rabbit	9	It was hot work even in the cold weather.	19
2255	The Cross Rabbit	6	First he took off his cap.	20
2256	The Cross Rabbit	3	Then his scarf.	21
2257	The Cross Rabbit	5	And then, even his gloves.	22
2258	The Cross Rabbit	5	Percy worked hard all morning.	23
2259	The Cross Rabbit	10	He mopped his brow again and looked at his work.	24
2260	The Cross Rabbit	6	“Very good,” he said to himself.	25
2261	The Cross Rabbit	8	“I think I deserve a spot of lunch.”	26
2262	The Cross Rabbit	10	Percy reached for his bag and pulled out a flask.	27
2263	The Cross Rabbit	4	“That’s funny,” he said.	28
2264	The Cross Rabbit	11	“I’m sure I put the cup on the top this morning.”	29
2265	The Cross Rabbit	13	“I know, I’ll have mg yogurt first and drink from the empty carton.”	30
2266	The Cross Rabbit	13	Percy took out a strawberry yogurt and began to rummage through his bag.	31
2267	The Cross Rabbit	4	‘That’s odd,” he said.	32
2268	The Cross Rabbit	2	“No spoon.	33
2269	The Cross Rabbit	1	Hmm.”	34
2270	The Cross Rabbit	5	It was a strange lunch.	35
2271	The Cross Rabbit	22	A lid was missing from a small box of dates and the bottom half of one of Percy’s cheese rolls had disappeared.	36
2272	The Cross Rabbit	17	And Percy was sure he had packed an orange but there was no sign of it now.	37
2273	The Cross Rabbit	5	It was all very puzzling.	38
2274	The Cross Rabbit	11	It felt colder to Percy as he went back to work.	39
2275	The Cross Rabbit	14	He reached for his scarf and his cap, but now they had disappeared too!	40
2276	The Cross Rabbit	6	“This is most peculiar,” said Percy.	41
2277	The Cross Rabbit	22	Then, as he gazed around looking for his cap and scarf, Percy was amazed to see his gloves walking off by themselves!	42
2278	The Cross Rabbit	6	“I must be dreaming,” said Percy.	43
2279	The Cross Rabbit	9	“I’d like to be dreaming,” said a cross voice.	44
2280	The Cross Rabbit	6	It was the old rabbit again.	45
2281	The Cross Rabbit	7	“Those mice are making a terrible noise.	46
2282	The Cross Rabbit	6	Would you speak to them please?”	47
2283	The Cross Rabbit	7	And with that the rabbit stumped off.	48
2284	The Cross Rabbit	2	Percy followed.	49
2285	The Cross Rabbit	4	“Look!” said the rabbit.	50
2286	The Cross Rabbit	2	Percy looked.	51
2287	The Cross Rabbit	7	The mice had been very busy indeed!	52
2288	The Cross Rabbit	7	And they were having a marvellous time.	53
2289	The Cross Rabbit	2	“Hello Percy!”	54
2290	The Cross Rabbit	2	they called.	55
2291	The Cross Rabbit	5	But suddenly they looked worried.	56
2292	The Cross Rabbit	10	“You’re not going to tell us to stop, are you?”	57
2293	The Cross Rabbit	6	Percy glanced at the old rabbit.	58
2294	The Cross Rabbit	8	“Well. . .no,” he said to the mice.	59
2295	The Cross Rabbit	14	“We just wondered if you could have a marvellous time a little more quietly?”	60
2296	The Cross Rabbit	3	The mice cheered.	61
2297	The Cross Rabbit	2	“We’ll try!”	62
2298	The Cross Rabbit	3	they squeaked loudly.	63
2299	The Cross Rabbit	7	“Come on,” said Percy to the rabbit.	64
2300	The Cross Rabbit	10	“I think I’ve got some cotton wool in my bag.	65
2301	The Cross Rabbit	9	A little in each ear should do the trick.”	66
2302	Shark In The Dark	15	Just before bedtime, a certain small boy stands at the window with his favourite toy.	0
2303	Shark In The Dark	9	Timothy Pope, Timothy Pope is looking through his telescope.	1
2304	Shark In The Dark	10	He looks at the sky and the moon up there.	2

2307	Shark In The Dark	3	He looks everywhere.	5
2308	Shark In The Dark	6	And this is what he sees.	6
2309	Shark In The Dark	2	Jumping jellyfish!	7
2310	Shark In The Dark	6	What’s that bobbing in the dark?	8
2311	Shark In The Dark	7	Could it be a GREAT WHITE SHARK?	9
2312	Shark In The Dark	2	A shark?	10
2313	Shark In The Dark	3	No it’s not.	11
2314	Shark In The Dark	6	It’s the sail on a yacht!	12
2315	Shark In The Dark	9	Timothy Pope, Timothy Pope is looking through his telescope.	13
2316	Shark In The Dark	10	He looks at the sky and the moon up there.	14

2319	Shark In The Dark	3	He looks everywhere.	17
2320	Shark In The Dark	6	And this is what he sees.	18
2321	Shark In The Dark	2	Stumbling starfish!	19
2322	Shark In The Dark	6	What’s that swishing through the dark?	20
2323	Shark In The Dark	7	Could it be a GREAT WHITE SHARK?	21
2324	Shark In The Dark	4	Tim says “Silly me!	22
2325	Shark In The Dark	6	It’s a seagull with his tea!”	23
2326	Shark In The Dark	9	Timothy Pope, Timothy Pope is looking through his telescope.	24
2327	Shark In The Dark	10	He looks at the sky and the moon up there.	25

2332	Shark In The Dark	2	Quivering catfish!	30
2333	Shark In The Dark	6	What’s that lurking in the dark?	31
2334	Shark In The Dark	7	Could it be a GREAT WHITE SHARK?	32
2335	Shark In The Dark	8	Don’t worry Tim, there’s no need to scream.	33
2336	Shark In The Dark	9	It isn’t a shark, it’s a giant ice cream!	34
2337	Shark In The Dark	9	Tim says to his dad, “I’m sure I’m right.	35
2338	Shark In The Dark	8	There are no sharks in the dark tonight.”	36
2339	A Thing Called Snow	20	Fox and Hare were born in the spring, grew up in the summer and were best of friends by autumn.	0
2340	A Thing Called Snow	16	Fox liked to jump, leap and bounce and was very good at sniffing far away things.	1
2341	A Thing Called Snow	17	m. Hare liked to bounce, leap and jump and was very good at hearing far away things.	2
2342	A Thing Called Snow	6	Then one day Fox's nose twitched.	3
2343	A Thing Called Snow	11	Hare’s ears pricked ... 'Winter is on its way,’ said Tern.	4
2344	A Thing Called Snow	19	I’m flying south, but soon you will be able to jump, leap, and bounce in this thing called snow!’	5
2345	A Thing Called Snow	5	But what exactly was snow?	6
2346	A Thing Called Snow	11	Before Fox and Hare could find out, Tern had already gone.	7
2347	A Thing Called Snow	15	They decided to venture into the great forest to ask Bear 'What is snow like?	8
2348	A Thing Called Snow	3	they said. .	9
2349	A Thing Called Snow	3	.... . ...	10
2350	A Thing Called Snow	8	'Snow is white, like your fur’ said Bear	11
2351	A Thing Called Snow	15	So they thanked Bear and set off looking for something as white as their fur.	12
2352	A Thing Called Snow	15	At the forests edge they found Caribou, who was nibbling something white among the grasses.	13
2353	A Thing Called Snow	7	'Excuse me,’ said Hare. 'Is that snow?’	14
2354	A Thing Called Snow	6	'No, these are flowers,’ said Caribou.	15
2355	A Thing Called Snow	1	'	16
2356	A Thing Called Snow	6	Snow is cold, like your noses.’	17
2357	A Thing Called Snow	17	So they thanked Caribou and bounded across the meadow, looking for something as cold as their noses.	18
2358	A Thing Called Snow	15	H Round a rocky bend, they found Salmon, leaping through an icy stream, flashing bright.	19
2359	A Thing Called Snow	7	'Hello, there,’ called Fox: ‘Is that snow?’	20
2360	A Thing Called Snow	6	‘No, this is spray,’ said Salmon.	21
2361	A Thing Called Snow	6	‘Snow is fluffy, like your tails.’	22
2362	A Thing Called Snow	13	So they followed the stream, searching for something as fluffy as their tails.	23
2363	A Thing Called Snow	11	Hare heard a honk and looked up at the great sky.	24
2364	A Thing Called Snow	3	Is that snow?	25
2365	A Thing Called Snow	8	he called to Goose, who was flying overhead.	26
2366	A Thing Called Snow	6	'No, these are clouds,’ said Goose.	27
2367	A Thing Called Snow	6	Snow is Sparkly, like your eyes.’	28
2368	A Thing Called Snow	12	Fox and Hare were now getting too tired and cold to search	29
2369	A Thing Called Snow	9	And it was starting for this thing called snow.	30
2370	A Thing Called Snow	3	to get dark.	31
2371	A Thing Called Snow	9	So they stepped by the edge of a lake.	32
2372	A Thing Called Snow	3	'Snow?' whispered fox.	33
2373	A Thing Called Snow	7	The inky water shimmered with something sparkly.	34
2374	A Thing Called Snow	8	‘Stars,’ yawned Hare, which means it's our bedtime.’	35
2375	A Thing Called Snow	15	But they were too far away to get home 'Let's sleep here tonight,’ said Fox.	36
2376	A Thing Called Snow	8	'We’ll find our way back in the morning.’	37
2377	A Thing Called Snow	5	Curled up together for warmth.	38
2378	A Thing Called Snow	6	Fox and Hare soon fell asleep.	39
2379	A Thing Called Snow	30	They didn’t see the white, cold, fluffy flakes that started to fall softly from the sky They didn't hear Bear and Caribou crunching through the snow to look for them.	40
2380	A Thing Called Snow	18	Hare and Fox woke up to a bright, white morning like no other 'Hello, snow ... 'Hello, snow!	41
2381	A Thing Called Snow	2	Hello snow!”	42
2382	A Thing Called Snow	2	they squealed.	43
2383	A Thing Called Snow	2	‘Hello, Bear!	44
2384	A Thing Called Snow	2	Hello Caribou!”	45
2385	A Thing Called Snow	15	they yelped, as they jumped, leapt, and bounced in the whitest, coldest, fluffiest, sparkliest snow.	46
2386	A Thing Called Snow	14	'We’re so glad we found you!' said Bear 'We were worried you were lost.'	47
2387	A Thing Called Snow	8	'New let’s find our way home,’ said Caribou.	48
2388	A Thing Called Snow	2	‘Follow us!’	49
2389	A Thing Called Snow	33	said Hare and Fox, who remembered every step they had taken around the lake, across the meadow, along the stream, through the forest… ... and they were followed by a thing called SNOW.	50

2417	The Way Home For Wolf	36	As a rainbow of lights flickered soft in the night, Dusting diamonds of ice in a desert of white, The wild, whipping wind, it whistled its tune, To a howling of wolves and a shimmering moon.	0
2418	The Way Home For Wolf	19	'AUKRROOooOOO' in And the loudest this echoing song Was a wolfling called Wilf at the heart of the throng.	1
2419	The Way Home For Wolf	10	He loved to be fierce and longed to be grown.	2
2420	The Way Home For Wolf	9	He liked to try everything ALL on his own.	3
2421	The Way Home For Wolf	3	“Look at me!	4
2422	The Way Home For Wolf	3	I am big!	5
2423	The Way Home For Wolf	3	I am tough!”	6
2424	The Way Home For Wolf	13	he would growl, whilst he showed off his strength and practised his prowl.	7
2425	The Way Home For Wolf	11	One night it was time for the wolves to move on...	8
2426	The Way Home For Wolf	10	New folks had moved in and their shelter was gone!	9
2427	The Way Home For Wolf	10	So they left right away to find a new cave.	10
2428	The Way Home For Wolf	12	They would have to walk far and they’d have to be brave.	11
2429	The Way Home For Wolf	8	“Let’s go!” shouted Wilf, “I’m ready to LEAD.”	12
2430	The Way Home For Wolf	11	“You’re too small,” laughed the wolves, “it’s an elder we need.”	13
2431	The Way Home For Wolf	10	“One day,” they advised, “you will guide from the front.”	14
2432	The Way Home For Wolf	10	“I suppose,” muttered Wilf with a huff and a grunt.	15
2433	The Way Home For Wolf	18	They struggled through snow as high as their flanks, and leapt over rocks as they scaled icy banks.	16
2434	The Way Home For Wolf	10	Wilf gave his all to keep pace and keep up.	17
2435	The Way Home For Wolf	11	But strong-willed as he was, he was still just a pup.	18
2436	The Way Home For Wolf	9	He kept dropping back with each clamber and climb.	19
2437	The Way Home For Wolf	9	as the pack journeyed further away all the time.	20
2438	The Way Home For Wolf	16	Exhausted and breathless, he strayed off the track when a blizzard blew in... . . .	21
2439	The Way Home For Wolf	6	and he lost his way back.	22
2440	The Way Home For Wolf	22	Wilf longed to howl, “Help!” and to holler it loud… But his throat was too hoarse and his heart was too proud.	23
2441	The Way Home For Wolf	10	He lay on the tundra, his tail curled up tight.	24
2442	The Way Home For Wolf	10	A blanket of stars was his bed for the night.	25
2443	The Way Home For Wolf	4	Crack! went the ice.	26
2444	The Way Home For Wolf	3	CRACK and Ker-eeeeeek!	27
2445	The Way Home For Wolf	9	Wilf jumped to all fours with a deafening shriek.	28
2446	The Way Home For Wolf	8	He stuck out the claws on every limb.	29
2447	The Way Home For Wolf	9	He HAD to hold on… because Wilflings can’t swim!	30
2448	The Way Home For Wolf	9	Then he fell and he fell, rolling and spinning.	31
2449	The Way Home For Wolf	28	It felt like the end, but it was just the beginning… …since somebody down there had heeded his scream, and she swooped from beneath like a watery dream.	32
2450	The Way Home For Wolf	3	“I’ll help you!”	33
2451	The Way Home For Wolf	2	she called.	34
2452	The Way Home For Wolf	5	“Just reach for my horn!”	35
2453	The Way Home For Wolf	6	A majestic and magical… SEA UNICORN!	36
2454	The Way Home For Wolf	19	Wilf’s pride washed away and he stretched out a paw, as she lifted him gently back onto the shore.	37
2455	The Way Home For Wolf	3	MR “Don’t worry!”	38
2456	The Way Home For Wolf	14	she sung before dipping her brow, “My friend WALRUS will help you out now.”	39
2457	The Way Home For Wolf	12	And there, right behind him, a huge, tusky fellow, Lifted his BELLOW!	40
2458	The Way Home For Wolf	8	whiskers and let out a “To the ridge!”	41
2459	The Way Home For Wolf	8	he proclaimed with his chin in the air.	42
2460	The Way Home For Wolf	9	“My friend, mighty MUSK-OX, will take you from here.	43
2461	The Way Home For Wolf	5	will take you from there.	44
2462	The Way Home For Wolf	19	And with waftings of fish and a very loud snort Their journey was made and their travel seemed short.	45
2463	The Way Home For Wolf	20	And there, sure enough, on the ridge was the ox, Who took Wilf as far as his friend ... ...	46
2464	The Way Home For Wolf	13	ARCTIC FOX Who followed his nose through the trees to a ... GOOSE	47
2465	The Way Home For Wolf	7	Who guided him, honking, to ... ...	48
2466	The Way Home For Wolf	3	this ancient MOOSE!	49
2467	The Way Home For Wolf	9	The moose knew these wilds like no other soul.	50
2468	The Way Home For Wolf	10	He was steady and true in pursuit of their goal.	51
2469	The Way Home For Wolf	16	And as twilight closed in, Moose sang out a call To a flittering, fluttering, tiny fluffball...	52
2470	The Way Home For Wolf	2	A BEAR-MOTH!	53
2471	The Way Home For Wolf	18	Who showed Wilf the rest of the way, to the place where this wolfling most wanted to stay.	54
2472	The Way Home For Wolf	2	“Thank you!”	55
2473	The Way Home For Wolf	7	Wilf waved as he rejoined his pack.	56
2474	The Way Home For Wolf	11	And the wolves howled with joy that their Wilfling was back.	57
2475	The Way Home For Wolf	19	They huddled him in a nd cuddled him close And fussed over which wolf had missed him the most.	58
2476	The Way Home For Wolf	17	ALL Wilf, he knew then, that when come together The darkest of times are easy to weather.	59
2477	The Way Home For Wolf	39	So he bowed to the narwhal, ox, walrus and goose, And vowed to the fox, and the moth, and the moose… “If ever I meet one who’s strayed off their track, I’ll help them along by guiding them back.”	60
2478	The Way Home For Wolf	9	And true to his word, Wilf is different now.	61
2479	The Way Home For Wolf	9	And his world seems much smaller and warmer somehow.	62
2480	The Way Home For Wolf	17	Since whenever life takes you, wherever you roam… we’re all just a handful of friendships from home.	63
2481	Elmer and Wilbur	16	Elmer, the patchwork elephant, was waiting for his cousin, Wilbur, who was coming to visit him.	0
2482	Elmer and Wilbur	4	“He’s late,” said Elmer.	1
2483	Elmer and Wilbur	3	“Perhaps he’s lost.	2
2484	Elmer and Wilbur	6	Let’s go and look for him.”	3
2485	Elmer and Wilbur	8	"“What does Wilbur look like?"" asked an elephant."	4
2486	Elmer and Wilbur	5	“Wait and see” chuckled Elmer.	5
2487	Elmer and Wilbur	12	“But be careful, Wilbur likes to play tricks, especially with his voice.	6
2488	Elmer and Wilbur	3	He’s a ventriloquist.	7
2489	Elmer and Wilbur	20	He can make his voice sound as if it’s coming from a different place to where he is, from anywhere.”	8
2490	Elmer and Wilbur	11	“This is fun,” said an elephant as they started to search.	9
2491	Elmer and Wilbur	3	“It’s like hide-and-seek.”	10
2492	Elmer and Wilbur	5	Suddenly they heard, “Yo Ho!	11
2493	Elmer and Wilbur	1	Elmer!	12
2494	Elmer and Wilbur	3	I’m over here.”	13
2495	Elmer and Wilbur	8	They rushed to where the voice came from.	14
2496	Elmer and Wilbur	8	“Looking for me?” asked a rather surprised tiger.	15
2497	Elmer and Wilbur	9	“Sorry” said Elmer, “we thought you were my cousin.”	16
2498	Elmer and Wilbur	6	“Very funny, Elmer,” said the tiger.	17
2499	Elmer and Wilbur	8	“Perhaps that’s your cousin I can hear shouting.”	18
2500	Elmer and Wilbur	4	“Help!”- called the voice.	19
2501	Elmer and Wilbur	1	“Help!	20
2502	Elmer and Wilbur	5	I’ve fallen in the pond.”	21
2503	Elmer and Wilbur	4	“He has, he has!	22
2504	Elmer and Wilbur	7	I can see him!” said an elephant.	23
2505	Elmer and Wilbur	3	“Silly,” said Elmer.	24
2506	Elmer and Wilbur	4	“That’s your own reflection.	25
2507	Elmer and Wilbur	2	Keep looking.	26
2508	Elmer and Wilbur	8	He’s near, but not where his voice is.”	27
2509	Elmer and Wilbur	15	They kept looking and all the time they looked, the voice came from different places.	28
2510	Elmer and Wilbur	3	It called, “COOEEE!	29
2511	Elmer and Wilbur	5	Here I am,” or “BOO!”	30
2512	Elmer and Wilbur	4	to make them jump.	31
2513	Elmer and Wilbur	8	It even came from down a rabbit hole.	32
2514	Elmer and Wilbur	8	The rabbits popped out, saying., “That’s not funny.	33
2515	Elmer and Wilbur	5	That’s not funny at all.	34
2516	Elmer and Wilbur	3	That’s very silly.”	35
2517	Elmer and Wilbur	13	After a lot of searching, an -elephant said, “We’ll never find him, Elmer.	36
2518	Elmer and Wilbur	3	Let’s give in.”	37
2519	Elmer and Wilbur	3	“Wilbur,” called Elmer.	38
2520	Elmer and Wilbur	8	“We give in; You can come out now.”	39
2521	Elmer and Wilbur	2	“I can’t.	40
2522	Elmer and Wilbur	11	I’m stuck up a tree,” Wilbur’s voice said from above them.	41
2523	Elmer and Wilbur	3	The elephants giggled.	42
2524	Elmer and Wilbur	5	“He’s very clever,” said one.	43
2525	Elmer and Wilbur	13	“If you don’t come,” said Elmer, “we’ll have to go home without you.	44
2526	Elmer and Wilbur	10	“I really am stuck up a tree,” said Wilbur’s voice.	45
2527	Elmer and Wilbur	4	The elephants giggled again.	46
2528	Elmer and Wilbur	4	“Elmer,” said an elephant.	47
2529	Elmer and Wilbur	5	“Is Wilbur black and white?	48
2530	Elmer and Wilbur	1	“Yes.	49
2531	Elmer and Wilbur	3	Why?” said Elmer.	50
2532	Elmer and Wilbur	5	“I peeped,” said the elephant.	51
2533	Elmer and Wilbur	7	“He really is stuck up a tree.”	52
2534	Elmer and Wilbur	3	They all looked.	53
2535	Elmer and Wilbur	6	There was Wilbur, up a tree.	54
2536	Elmer and Wilbur	3	“Wilbur,” gasped Elmer.	55
2537	Elmer and Wilbur	6	“How did you get up there?”	56
2538	Elmer and Wilbur	18	“Never mind how I got up, how do I get down?” said Wilbur “I’ve no idea” said Elmer.	57
2539	Elmer and Wilbur	9	“But we’re hungry so we’re going home for tea.	58
2540	Elmer and Wilbur	8	At least we know where you are now.	59
2541	Elmer and Wilbur	2	Goodbye, Wilbur.	60
2542	Elmer and Wilbur	3	See you tomorrow.”	61
2543	Elmer and Wilbur	10	With that, Elmer started to lead the other elephants away.	62
2544	Elmer and Wilbur	4	“Oh, Elmer,” called Wilbur.	63
2545	Elmer and Wilbur	3	“Don’t leave me.	64
2546	Elmer and Wilbur	2	I’m starving.”	65
2547	Elmer and Wilbur	12	“Ha, ha, I was just teasing,” laughed Elmer, turning back to Wilbur.	66
2548	Elmer and Wilbur	19	“If you walk along the branch it will bend down with your weight and we can help you down.”	67
2549	Elmer and Wilbur	6	Wilbur walked slowly along the branch.	68
2550	Elmer and Wilbur	6	The branch began to bend down.	69
2551	Elmer and Wilbur	18	When the elephants could reach, they pulled the branch the rest of the way and helped Wilbur off.	70
2552	Elmer and Wilbur	3	“Thanks,” said Wilbur.	71
2553	Elmer and Wilbur	8	“Now, where’s that tea you were talking about?”	72
2554	Elmer and Wilbur	11	Then laughing and joking together they raced all the way home.	73
2555	Elmer and Wilbur	12	That night, as they lay down to sleep, Elmer said, “Goodnight, Wilbur.	74
2556	Elmer and Wilbur	2	Goodnight, Moon.”	75
2557	Elmer and Wilbur	12	A voice that seemed to come from the moon said, “Goodnight, elephants.	76
2558	Elmer and Wilbur	2	Sweet dreams.”	77
2559	Elmer and Wilbur	11	Elmer smiled and whispered “Wilburhow DID you get up that tree?”	78
2560	Elmer and Wilbur	5	But Wilbur was already asleep.	79
2561	One Starry Night	12	One Starry night, a shepherd boy came over a hill near Bethlehem.	0
2562	One Starry Night	7	Behind him came one little sheep, half-asleep.	1

2577	One Starry Night	11	“Baa Baa Baa Baa Baa Baa” said the six little sheep.	16
2578	One Starry Night	11	Another little sheep came over the hill, stumbling on the path.	17

2580	One Starry Night	3	Baa Baa Baa	19

2591	One Starry Night	15	“Baa Baa Baa Baa Baa Baa Baa Baa Baa Baa” said the ten little sheep.	30
2592	One Starry Night	12	They huddled together with the shepherd boy, and started to fall asleep...	31
2593	One Starry Night	5	And then - it happened!	32
2594	One Starry Night	10	A glorious angel appeared, and the sheep were very afraid.	33
2595	One Starry Night	15	“Baa Baa Baa Baa Baa Baa Baa Baa Baa Baa” said the ten little sheep.	34
2596	One Starry Night	10	“Whaaaaat?” said the shepherd boy, who was very afraid too.	35
2597	One Starry Night	24	He was so afraid that he shivered and shook, and his mouth stayed open for quite a few minutes in a big, round ‘O'.	36
2598	One Starry Night	6	“Don’t be afraid!” said the angel.	37
2599	One Starry Night	7	“I’m here to bring you good news.	38

2602	One Starry Night	11	He's been born in Bethlehem, and is lying in a manger.”	41
2603	One Starry Night	14	Then the starry sky was filled with light, and the sound of angels singing.	42

2605	One Starry Night	6	“Glory to God in the highest.	44
2606	One Starry Night	10	Glory to God in the highest and peace on earth.	45

2610	One Starry Night	21	And, with Mary, his mother, and Joseph there too, they found - just as the angels had promised - a baby!	49
2611	One Starry Night	26	A baby, lying in a manger; a baby, lying in a manger in a stable; a baby, lying in a manger in a stable in Bethlehem.	50
2612	One Starry Night	13	Then the shepherd bo y and the ten little sheep worshipped the baby.	51
2613	One Starry Night	10	because they knew he was Jesus, the son of God.	52
2614	One Starry Night	13	Dawn came, rosy pink, into a silent world, on that first Christmas morning.	53
2615	One Starry Night	10	The angels and the stars had disappeared into the sky.	54
2616	One Starry Night	49	The shepherd boy and the one little, two little, three little, four little, five little, six little, seven little, eight little, nine little, ten little sheep, went running over the hills and far away, to tell the whole world that Jesus’ the Saviour of the world, had been born.	55

2624	I Need A Wee	4	“I need a wee!	7
2625	I Need A Wee	8	But first I need just one more go.”	8
2626	I Need A Wee	3	“No,” said Giraffe.	9
2627	I Need A Wee	9	“When you’ve got to go, you’ve got to go.”	10

2678	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	9	That was because of Sam showing him her filling.	3
2679	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	14	Harry wanted to take his dinosaurs, but they were hiding all over the place.	4
2680	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	5	He called all their names.	5
2681	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	8	He said, “Get in the bucket, my Stegosaurus.”	6
2682	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	8	And out came Stegosaurus from under the pillow.	7
2683	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	8	He said, “Get in the bucket, my Triceratops.”	8
2684	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	8	And out came Triceratops from inside the drawer.	9
2685	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	22	And one by one, Apatosaurus and Scelidosaurus and Anchisaurus all came out of their hiding places and they jumped into the bucket.	10
2686	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	4	All except for Tyrannosaurus.	11
2687	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	12	He didn’t want to go because he had a lot of teeth.	12
2688	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	9	He thought Mr Drake might do drilling on them.	13
2689	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	25	Harry said, “Don’t worry, because when we get there, I shall press a magic button on my bucket, and that will make you grow big.”	14
2690	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	14	In the waiting room, the nurse said, “Hello, Harry. Are you a good boy?”	15
2691	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	8	Harry said, “I am, but my dinosaurs bite.”	16
2692	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	5	Mr Drake called, “Next please!”	17
2693	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	8	The nurse took Harry into Mr Drake’s room.	18
2694	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	7	Harry wasn’t sure about the big chair.	19
2695	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	11	He thought maybe that was where Mr Drake did the drilling.	20
2696	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	11	“Come and have a ride in my chair,” said Mr Drake.	21
2697	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	5	“It goes up and down.”	22
2698	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	5	Harry didn’t want to ride.	23
2699	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	11	“Would one of your dinosaurs like a go?” asked Mr Drake.	24
2700	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	6	Harry put Tyrannosaurus on the chair.	25
2701	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	13	He whispered to him not to worry, then he pressed the magic button…	26
2702	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	4	Tyrannosaurus grew VERY BIG!	27
2703	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	14	“Open wide,” said Mr Drake, and then he turned around ... “RAAAAHH!” said Tyrannosaurus.	28
2704	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	8	“Help!” cried Mr Drake, hiding behind the door.	29
2705	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	5	“Harry, what shall I do?”	30
2706	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	5	Harry pressed the magic button.	31
2707	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	9	Straight away, Tyrannosaurus went back to being bucket sized.	32
2708	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	16	Harry felt safer now about getting into the chair, so he climbed in with his bucket.	33
2709	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	10	Then Harry and his dinosaurs all had a ride together.	34
2710	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	12	They opened their mouths wide for Mr Drake and all went, “RAAAAHH!”	35
2711	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	8	Mr Drake said, “What a lot of teeth!	36
2712	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	4	Will they bite me?”	37
2713	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	6	Harry said, “They only bite drills.”	38
2714	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	18	“You are all good brushers,” said Mr Drake, “so no drills today, only a look and a rinse.”	39
2715	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	9	All the dinosaurs liked riding and they liked rinsing.	40
2716	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	8	“Another bucket of mouthwash, Joan!” called Mr Drake.	41
2717	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	15	Going home, Mum let Harry choose a book from the library for being so good.	42
2718	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	7	“Let’s have a shark book!” said Harry.	43
2719	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	4	“RAAAAHH!” said the dinosaurs.	44
2720	Harry and the Dinosaurs say Raahh!	2	“Sharp teeth!	45

2880	The Owl's Lesson	9	“Percy,” said the squirrel, “have you got any string?”	36

2886	The Owl's Lesson	5	“I’ll give you a piggy-back.”	42
2887	The Owl's Lesson	19	Percy looked puzzled as the squirrel began to climb a tree with a very nervous passenger on his back.	43
2888	The Owl's Lesson	10	“He needs to get used to heights,” explained the squirrel.	44

2890	The Owl's Lesson	5	“It’s a tightrope,” he said.	46
2891	The Owl's Lesson	2	“Follow me!”	47
2892	The Owl's Lesson	8	Balancing carefully, the squirrel stepped onto the string.	48
2893	The Owl's Lesson	5	The little bird bravely followed.	49
2894	The Owl's Lesson	4	“Hooray!” cheered the mole.	50
2895	The Owl's Lesson	4	“Well done!” called Percy.	51

2992	The Dinosaur Department Store	7	It’s time to choose your OWD dinosaur!”	38
2993	The Dinosaur Department Store	7	But Eliza Jane had turned to go.	39
2994	The Dinosaur Department Store	9	“Thank you,” she said, “but my answer is NO.	40
2995	The Dinosaur Department Store	14	I did enjoy your Wonderful tour, But I no longer want a real dinosaur.”	41

3003	The Fox's Hiccups	25	The first stars were beginning to show in the sky as Percy the park keeper made his way home to his hut in the park.	0
3004	The Fox's Hiccups	13	He had been working hard all day and he was tired and hungry.	1
3005	The Fox's Hiccups	12	Now he was looking forward to his supper and a good rest.	2
3006	The Fox's Hiccups	16	As Percy plodded on he saw his friend the fox coming up the path towards him.	3
3007	The Fox's Hiccups	8	The fox was on his way home too.	4
3008	The Fox's Hiccups	9	“Good night,” said Percy as they passed each other.	5
3009	The Fox's Hiccups	6	“Good night, hic-Percy,” answered the fox.	6
3010	The Fox's Hiccups	4	The fox had hiccups.	7
3011	The Fox's Hiccups	25	The fox had been drinking some fizzy lemonade when a squirrel told him a funny joke about a parrot, a worm, and a cricket bat.	8
3012	The Fox's Hiccups	5	The fox exploded with laughter.	9
3013	The Fox's Hiccups	22	It was then that he had learnt that it is not a good idea to laugh and drink at the same time.	10
3014	The Fox's Hiccups	6	He had had hiccups all afternoon.	11
3015	The Fox's Hiccups	15	“I wonder if hic-Percy knows a good cure for hic-cups,” the fox said to himself.	12
3016	The Fox's Hiccups	16	“I th-hic I’ll ask him,” he said and with that he turned and followed after Percy.	13
3017	The Fox's Hiccups	19	When he got back to his hut, Percy remembered that he still had one or two jobs to do.	14
3018	The Fox's Hiccups	5	First, he watered some plants.	15
3019	The Fox's Hiccups	9	“I’d better get my washing in too,” said Percy.	16
3020	The Fox's Hiccups	13	“Then, it’s two boiled eggs for me and a pile of toast soldiers.”	17
3021	The Fox's Hiccups	4	The fox hurried on.	18
3022	The Fox's Hiccups	6	He wasn’t afraid of the dark.	19
3023	The Fox's Hiccups	8	He just liked the light better, that’s all.	20
3024	The Fox's Hiccups	4	But where was Percy?	21
3025	The Fox's Hiccups	17	He ran round the side of the hut, but instead of finding Percy, he found Percy’s washing.	22
3026	The Fox's Hiccups	18	Then, with a crash and a tumble which hurt his foot, he found a pile of flower pots.	23
3027	The Fox's Hiccups	4	“Oooowww-hic-ooww!” wailed the fox.	24
3028	The Fox's Hiccups	6	Percy was surprised by the crash.	25
3029	The Fox's Hiccups	7	He stuck his head round the corner.	26
3030	The Fox's Hiccups	15	But when Percy saw what had made the crash, he quickly pulled it back again.	27
3031	The Fox's Hiccups	2	“It’s. .	28
3032	The Fox's Hiccups	3	.it’s a ghost!”	29
3033	The Fox's Hiccups	2	he gasped.	30
3034	The Fox's Hiccups	7	Percy had never met a ghost before.	31
3035	The Fox's Hiccups	6	He felt he should introduce himself.	32
3036	The Fox's Hiccups	8	But what should he say to a ghost?	33
3037	The Fox's Hiccups	3	Percy listened hard.	34
3038	The Fox's Hiccups	10	He could hear the ghost still moaning and thumping about.	35
3039	The Fox's Hiccups	8	Suddenly, there was another loud crash, then silence.	36
3040	The Fox's Hiccups	17	Percy was just beginning to wonder if perhaps the ghost had disappeared when there came another sound.	37
3041	The Fox's Hiccups	3	A small sound.	38
3042	The Fox's Hiccups	15	It was not the sort of sound that Percy expected to hear from a ghost.	39
3043	The Fox's Hiccups	2	“Hie. .	40
3044	The Fox's Hiccups	1	.burp.”	41
3045	The Fox's Hiccups	6	A smile spread over Percy’s face.	42
3046	The Fox's Hiccups	8	Percy poked his head round the corner again.	43
3047	The Fox's Hiccups	10	This time, what he saw made him roar with laughter.	44
3048	The Fox's Hiccups	11	“Do you need any help, Mr Ghost?” said Percy, still laughing.	45
3049	The Fox's Hiccups	10	“Yes, please,” came a muffled reply from inside the barrel.	46
3050	The Fox's Hiccups	9	“Could you possibly turn me the right way up?”	47
3051	The Fox's Hiccups	9	Percy helped the fox back on to his feet.	48
3052	The Fox's Hiccups	8	“You gave me quite a shock,” said Percy.	49
3053	The Fox's Hiccups	7	“I gave myself one,” said the fox.	50
3054	The Fox's Hiccups	8	“But it seems to have cured my hiccups!”	51

3173	The Rescue Party	13	Then he propped himself against an old tree stump and opened his book.	4
3174	The Rescue Party	10	The animals settled themselves around Percy and waited for tea.	5
3175	The Rescue Party	12	It was warm in the sunshine and soon everyone began to doze.	6
3176	The Rescue Party	9	Suddenly they were disturbed by the sound of laughter.	7
3177	The Rescue Party	3	Percy looked up.	8
3178	The Rescue Party	18	Three young rabbits, two brothers and their little sister, were playing a leaping game in the long grass.	9
3179	The Rescue Party	7	When they saw Percy, the rabbits waved.	10
3180	The Rescue Party	2	“Hello Percy!	11
3181	The Rescue Party	5	We’re pretending to be hares.”	12
3182	The Rescue Party	11	Percy chuckled and waved back as the rabbits went leaping away.	13
3183	The Rescue Party	8	The three rabbits were having a wonderful time.	14
3184	The Rescue Party	7	“I can jump the longest!” said one.	15
3185	The Rescue Party	8	“I can run the fastest!” said his brother.	16
3186	The Rescue Party	16	“I can jump the highest!” said the smallest rabbit and she jumped high into the air.	17
3187	The Rescue Party	1	“Wheeeee!”	18
3188	The Rescue Party	13	But as the little rabbit landed, to her brothers’ surprise, she completely disappeared!	19
3189	The Rescue Party	12	She had crashed right through the rotten cover of an old well.	20
3190	The Rescue Party	10	The two brothers stared at the hole in the ground.	21
3191	The Rescue Party	5	Then they began to wail.	22
3192	The Rescue Party	1	“Help!	23
3193	The Rescue Party	6	The ground has eaten our sister!”	24
3194	The Rescue Party	1	“Help!	25
3195	The Rescue Party	2	Somebody help!”	26
3196	The Rescue Party	5	Somebody, of course, meant Percy.	27
3197	The Rescue Party	13	The two rabbits ran straight to him and told him what had happened.	28
3198	The Rescue Party	10	The other animals looked worried as Percy listened and sighed.	29
3199	The Rescue Party	12	“There’s no water in that well,” he said, “but it’s very deep.”	30
3200	The Rescue Party	10	He pulled on his cap and jumped to his feet.	31
3201	The Rescue Party	6	“We’ll need a rope,” he said.	32
3202	The Rescue Party	2	“Come on.”	33
3203	The Rescue Party	9	Percy raced away with the animals following behind him.	34
3204	The Rescue Party	12	Before long he was leading them back again towards the old well.	35
3205	The Rescue Party	8	Over his shoulder, Percy carried a long rope.	36
3206	The Rescue Party	17	Percy cleared away the rotten wood that had covered the well, and peered into the dark hole.	37
3207	The Rescue Party	6	He couldn’t see the little rabbit.	38
3208	The Rescue Party	15	She was perched on a log that had wedged itself half way down the well.	39
3209	The Rescue Party	3	“Helloooo,” called Percy.	40
3210	The Rescue Party	4	“Can you hear me?”	41
3211	The Rescue Party	6	A rather cross little voice answered.	42
3212	The Rescue Party	4	“I bumped my head.”	43
3213	The Rescue Party	6	“But are you alright?” asked Percy.	44
3214	The Rescue Party	9	“I bumped my head,” answered the cross voice again.	45
3215	The Rescue Party	7	“Hmm,” said Percy, “I think she’s alright.”	46
3216	The Rescue Party	7	“We’re sending down a rope,” called Percy.	47
3217	The Rescue Party	10	“Tie it nice and tight and we’ll pull you up.”	48
3218	The Rescue Party	7	Percy lowered the rope into the well.	49
3219	The Rescue Party	22	The little rabbit wasn’t quite sure what to do, so she tied it tightly to the log that she was sitting on.	50
3220	The Rescue Party	4	“Now, heave-ho!” said Percy.	51
3221	The Rescue Party	8	Percy pulled on the rope, but nothing happened.	52
3222	The Rescue Party	3	He pulled again.	53
3223	The Rescue Party	4	“What’s she been eating?”	54
3224	The Rescue Party	2	he muttered.	55
3225	The Rescue Party	4	“She weighs a ton.”	56
3226	The Rescue Party	8	He pulled once more, but still nothing happened.	57
3227	The Rescue Party	2	Percy frowned.	58
3228	The Rescue Party	10	“Alright,” he said, “let’s see what we can do together.”	59
3229	The Rescue Party	15	Down in the well, the little rabbit was beginning to get used to the darkness.	60
3230	The Rescue Party	18	As she gazed around, she noticed that there was a small opening in the wall of the well.	61
3231	The Rescue Party	8	“I wonder where that leads to,” she said.	62
3232	The Rescue Party	18	At the top of the well, the rescuers lined up behind Percy, ready to pull on the rope.	63
3233	The Rescue Party	3	“Ready,” shouted Percy.	64
3234	The Rescue Party	1	“Heave!”	65
3235	The Rescue Party	5	Something in the well moved.	66
3236	The Rescue Party	6	“Keep going,” said Percy, “she’s coming.”	67
3237	The Rescue Party	5	The rescuers pulled and pulled.	68
3238	The Rescue Party	8	They grunted and groaned and quacked and squeaked.	69
3239	The Rescue Party	4	Up came the rope.	70
3240	The Rescue Party	12	But as it reached the top, the rescuers got a terrible surprise.	71
3241	The Rescue Party	11	There was no little rabbit on the end of the rope.	72
3242	The Rescue Party	13	All they had pulled up from the well was a great big log!	73
3243	The Rescue Party	5	“Well I’m blessed!” said Percy.	74
3244	The Rescue Party	4	“What’s happened to her?”	75
3245	The Rescue Party	8	“She’s turned into a log!” said the fox.	76
3246	The Rescue Party	10	“She’s at the bottom of the well!” said the squirrels.	77
3247	The Rescue Party	6	“She’s lost forever!” wailed the rabbits.	78
3248	The Rescue Party	12	“Oh no I’m not,” said a little voice behind them, “I’m here...”	79
3249	The Rescue Party	5	Everyone looked round in amazement.	80
3250	The Rescue Party	13	There at the back of the line of rescuers was the little rabbit.	81
3251	The Rescue Party	7	“I thought I’d help you,” she said.	82
3252	The Rescue Party	4	“What are we doing?”	83
3253	The Rescue Party	7	Percy and the animals began to laugh.	84
3254	The Rescue Party	9	They laughed and laughed until they couldn’t stand up.	85
3255	The Rescue Party	12	“But how did you manage to get out?” asked Percy at last.	86
3256	The Rescue Party	5	“It was easy,” she said.	87
3257	The Rescue Party	5	“I found a secret passage.	88
3258	The Rescue Party	6	It comes out just over there.”	89
3259	The Rescue Party	5	“Well I never!” said Percy.	90
3260	The Rescue Party	3	“Well, well, well.	91
3261	The Rescue Party	15	Which reminds me,” he added, “I must make a new cover for that old well.”	92
3262	The Rescue Party	15	“I’ll do it tomorrow,” said Percy as he led the way back towards their picnic.	93
3263	The Rescue Party	9	“After all,” he said, “today is my day off.”	94
3264	Elmer and the Stranger	13	Elmer, the patchwork elephant, had just started his morning walk when Tiger arrived.	0
3265	Elmer and the Stranger	12	“Elmer,” he said, “there’s a stranger around and he’s acting very strangely.	1
3266	Elmer and the Stranger	5	He jumps and falls over.”	2
3267	Elmer and the Stranger	10	“Strangers often act strangely; that’s why they’re strangers,” said Elmer.	3
3268	Elmer and the Stranger	8	“Well I don’t think he’s happy,” said Tiger.	4
3269	Elmer and the Stranger	4	Just then Lion appeared.	5
3270	Elmer and the Stranger	2	“Hello, Elmer.	6
3271	Elmer and the Stranger	4	Hello, Tiger,” he said.	7
3272	Elmer and the Stranger	6	“Elmer, there’s a strange chap around.	8
3273	Elmer and the Stranger	5	He sort of... sort of...”	9
3274	Elmer and the Stranger	3	“Jumps,” said Tiger.	10
3275	Elmer and the Stranger	2	“Elmer knows.”	11
3276	Elmer and the Stranger	7	“And then he kind of... well he...”	12
3277	Elmer and the Stranger	4	“Falls over” finished Tiger.	13
3278	Elmer and the Stranger	2	“Elmer knows.”	14
3279	Elmer and the Stranger	5	“Yes, well also he seems...	15
3280	Elmer and the Stranger	1	aah...”	16
3281	Elmer and the Stranger	3	“Unhappy,” said Tiger.	17
3282	Elmer and the Stranger	2	“Elmer knows.”	18
3283	Elmer and the Stranger	8	“Let’s just go and see,” said Elmer kindly.	19
3284	Elmer and the Stranger	6	Soon they came to a clearing.	20
3285	Elmer and the Stranger	8	“This is where he usually jumps” said Tiger.	21
3286	Elmer and the Stranger	5	And falls over” added Lion.	22
3287	Elmer and the Stranger	4	“And here he comes.”	23
3288	Elmer and the Stranger	9	With huge bounces, into the clearing came a kangaroo.	24
3289	Elmer and the Stranger	7	Then he stopped, hesitated, and fell over.	25
3290	Elmer and the Stranger	9	He picked himself up and sobbed, “I’m a failure.”	26
3291	Elmer and the Stranger	6	“Not a happy chappy,” said Lion.	27
3292	Elmer and the Stranger	6	“Let’s talk to him,” said Elmer.	28
3293	Elmer and the Stranger	3	“Hello,” said Elmer.	29
3294	Elmer and the Stranger	3	“What’s the matter?”	30
3295	Elmer and the Stranger	3	“Hello,” Kangaroo sniffed.	31
3296	Elmer and the Stranger	3	“I can’t jump.	32
3297	Elmer and the Stranger	7	When I try to, I fall over.	33
3298	Elmer and the Stranger	14	We’re going to have a jumping competition and I came here to practise, secretly.	34
3299	Elmer and the Stranger	4	But it’s no use.	35
3300	Elmer and the Stranger	3	I can’t jump.	36
3301	Elmer and the Stranger	4	I’ll be laughed at.”	37
3302	Elmer and the Stranger	18	“But you were jumping beautifully,” said Tiger “Oh no, I was just bouncing along getting ready to jump...	38
3303	Elmer and the Stranger	19	I’m a good bouncer” said Kangaroo and, to prove it, bounced higher than Giraffe who happened to be passing.	39
3304	Elmer and the Stranger	4	“Very impressive,” said Tiger.	40
3305	Elmer and the Stranger	12	“But when I think about the jump I fall over,” sighed Kangaroo.	41
3306	Elmer and the Stranger	6	“This needs some thought,” said Elmer.	42
3307	Elmer and the Stranger	4	“We’ll be back tomorrow.”	43
3308	Elmer and the Stranger	21	On the way home, Lion said, “Elmer, I know I’m a bit slow, but isn’t a bounce a kind of jump?”	44
3309	Elmer and the Stranger	4	“Yes, Lion,” said Elmer.	45
3310	Elmer and the Stranger	12	“But Kangaroo thinks that a jump is something more difficult, more important.	46
3311	Elmer and the Stranger	11	Like sometimes if you think about going to sleep, you can’t.	47
3312	Elmer and the Stranger	10	When you don’t think about it, you soon drop off.”	48
3313	Elmer and the Stranger	7	“Lion doesn’t have that problem,” said Tiger.	49
3314	Elmer and the Stranger	5	Elmer laughed and left them.	50
3315	Elmer and the Stranger	14	The next morning, after talking to Lion and Tiger, Elmer went to meet Kangaroo.	51
3316	Elmer and the Stranger	5	“Come on, Kangaroo,” he said.	52
3317	Elmer and the Stranger	8	“Lion and Tiger will be by the river.”	53
3318	Elmer and the Stranger	22	Elmer set off at a steady pace while Kangaroo bounced behind him, in front of him, around him and even over him.	54
3319	Elmer and the Stranger	19	At the river, they saw Lion and Tiger on the other side, where Elmer had told them to wait.	55
3320	Elmer and the Stranger	3	“Drat!” said Elmer.	56
3321	Elmer and the Stranger	5	“We’ll get our feet wet.”	57
3322	Elmer and the Stranger	12	Kangaroo laughed, and with an enormous bounce landed beside Lion and Tiger.	58
3323	Elmer and the Stranger	4	“Fantastic jump” said Tiger.	59
3324	Elmer and the Stranger	5	“You mean ‘bounce’ said Kangaroo.	60
3325	Elmer and the Stranger	3	“I can’t jump.”	61
3326	Elmer and the Stranger	2	Lion chuckled.	62
3327	Elmer and the Stranger	5	“A bounce IS a jump.”	63
3328	Elmer and the Stranger	4	“Lion’s right” said Elmer.	64
3329	Elmer and the Stranger	4	“Forget jumping, just bounce.	65
3330	Elmer and the Stranger	6	Now let’s go to that competition!”	66
3331	Elmer and the Stranger	13	Kangaroo led the way, delighted that his new friends were going with him.	67
3332	Elmer and the Stranger	7	They arrived just as the competition began.	68
3333	Elmer and the Stranger	1	li	69
3334	Elmer and the Stranger	14	After a while, Elmer said, “Come on, Kangaroo, it’s time you had a go.”	70
3335	Elmer and the Stranger	14	There was a roar of applause as a white kangaroo made an enormous jump.	71
3336	Elmer and the Stranger	8	“That will be hard to beat,” said Kangaroo.	72
3337	Elmer and the Stranger	6	Elmer whispered to Lion and Tiger.	73
3338	Elmer and the Stranger	16	They grinned and went to stand just past the spot where the white kangaroo had landed.	74
3339	Elmer and the Stranger	8	As Kangaroo was getting ready, Elmer said, “Drat!	75
3340	Elmer and the Stranger	5	We’ll get our feet wet.”	76
3341	Elmer and the Stranger	16	Kangaroo gave a laugh, and with an enormous bounce once again landed beside Lion and Tiger.	77
3342	Elmer and the Stranger	5	That jump won the competition.	78
3343	Elmer and the Stranger	10	Later, Kangaroo thanked Elmer, Lion and Tiger for their help.	79
3344	Elmer and the Stranger	8	“You made me remember the river,” he said.	80
3345	Elmer and the Stranger	5	“I didn’t think about jumping.”	81
3346	Elmer and the Stranger	16	When they were back home, Lion said, “Strange thing, I felt that we were the... aah...”	82
3347	Elmer and the Stranger	3	“Strangers,” finished Tiger.	83
3348	Elmer and the Stranger	3	“Yes,” laughed Elmer.	84
3349	Elmer and the Stranger	5	“And now we’re all... aah...”	85
3350	Elmer and the Stranger	1	“Friends!”	86
3351	Elmer and the Stranger	3	they laughed together.	87
3352	Dinosaurs Love Underpants	44	Dinosaurs were all wiped out, A long way back in history, No one knows quite how or why, Now this book solves the mystery… It all began when cavemen, Felt embarrassed in the nude, So someone dreamt up underpants, To stop them looking rude.	0
3353	Dinosaurs Love Underpants	17	The dinosaurs roamed everywhere, All teeth and huge long necks, But scariest and meanest, Was Tyrannosaurus rex!	1
3354	Dinosaurs Love Underpants	5	When T-rex saw Man’s knickers.	2
3355	Dinosaurs Love Underpants	16	He roared with deafening rants, “I don’t want to eat you up, I want your underpants!”	3
3356	Dinosaurs Love Underpants	18	T-rex pinched a furry pair, But his pants quickly ripped, He couldn’t get them past his feet, Oh!	4
3357	Dinosaurs Love Underpants	1	Whoops!	5
3358	Dinosaurs Love Underpants	2	Watch out!	6
3359	Dinosaurs Love Underpants	2	He tripped!	7
3360	Dinosaurs Love Underpants	18	Triceratops was happy, Wearing pants on every horn, Till Styracosaurus snatched them, And they ended up all torn.	8
3361	Dinosaurs Love Underpants	2	W ?	9
3362	Dinosaurs Love Underpants	19	The pants from Woolly Mammoth coats, Made Stegosaurus itchy, Diplodocus was really cross, His pants were far too titchy!	10
3363	Dinosaurs Love Underpants	7	“We’ve too few knickers to go around!”	11
3364	Dinosaurs Love Underpants	14	The cavemen quaked in shock, “These dinos are pants crazy, They’ve completely run amok!”	12
3365	Dinosaurs Love Underpants	20	Soon pants were flying everywhere, All slit by tooth and claw, The dinosaurs were fighting, In a great pants tug-of-war.	13
3366	Dinosaurs Love Underpants	12	The Mighty Pants War raged all night, THUMP, POW, BASH, 1HWACK, CLOUT!	14
3367	Dinosaurs Love Underpants	11	The fighting got so crazy, All the dinos were wiped out!	15
3368	Dinosaurs Love Underpants	14	The next day, out the cavemen crept, And cheered at what they saw, “Hooray!	16
3369	Dinosaurs Love Underpants	9	Our biggest enemy, Is now at last no more!”	17
3370	Dinosaurs Love Underpants	22	So when you put your pants on, Always treat them with great care, Pants and knickers saved Mankind, They’re not just underwear!	18
3371	Zog	8	Madam Dragon ran a school, many moons ago.	0
3372	Zog	12	She taught young dragons all the things that dragons need to know.	1
3373	Zog	11	Zpg, the biggest dragon, was- the keen est one by far.	2
3374	Zog	11	He tried his hardest every day to win a golden star.	3
3375	Zog	11	All the dragons in Year One were learning how to fly.	4
3376	Zog	4	“High!” said Madam Dragon.	5
3377	Zog	5	“Way up in the sky!	6
3378	Zog	11	“Now that you’ve been shown, you can practise on your own.	7
3379	Zog	12	And you’ll all be expert fliers by the time you’re fully grown.”	8
3380	Zog	10	Zog went off to practis e, flying fast and free.	9
3381	Zog	11	He soared and swooped and looped the loop . . .	10
3382	Zog	5	then crashed into a tree.	11
3383	Zog	8	Just then, a little girl ca me by.	12
3384	Zog	6	“Oh, please don’t cry,” she said.	13
3385	Zog	10	“Perhaps you’d like a nice sticky plaster for your head?”	14
3386	Zog	6	“What a good idea!” said Zog.	15
3387	Zog	16	Then up and off he flew, His plaster gleaming pinkly as he zigzagged through the blue.	16
3388	Zog	14	A year went by, and in Year Two the dragons lear ned to roar.	17
3389	Zog	5	• “More!” said Madam Dragon.	18
3390	Zog	4	“Louder, I implore! '	19
3391	Zog	12	Now that you’ve been shown, y ou can practise on your own.	20
3392	Zog	12	And you’ll all be champion roarers by the time you’re fully grown!	21
3393	Zog	5	Zog went off to practise.	22
3394	Zog	5	He roared with fearsome force.	23
3395	Zog	11	He kept it up for hours on end . . .	24
3396	Zog	6	but then his throat grew hoarse.	25
3397	Zog	7	Just then the girl came by again.	26
3398	Zog	5	She said, “What rotten luck!	27
3399	Zog	9	Perhaps you’d like a nice soothing peppermint to suck?”	28
3400	Zog	6	“What a good idea!” said Zog.	29
3401	Zog	16	Then up and off he flew, And breathing fumes of peppermint he zigzagged through the blue.	30
3402	Zog	13	A year went by, and in Year Three the dragons learned to blow.	31
3403	Zog	4	“No!” said Madam Dragon.	32
3404	Zog	5	“Breathe out fire, not snow!	33
3405	Zog	24	Now that you’ve been shown, you can practis e on your own, And you’ll all be breathing bonfires by the time you’re fully grown.”	34
3406	Zog	5	Zog went off to practise.	35
3407	Zog	6	He blew with all his might.	36
3408	Zog	12	He twirled around in triumph ... and his wing tip caught alight.	37
3409	Zog	7	Just then the girl came by again.	38
3410	Zog	7	She said, “You poor old th ing.	39
3411	Zog	10	Perhaps you’d like a nice stretchy bandage for your wing?”	40
3412	Zog	6	“What a good idea!” said Zog.	41
3413	Zog	17	Then up a nd off he flew, His bandage flapping wildly as he zigzagged through the blue.	42
3414	Zog	12	All the Year Four dragons were learning — c an you guess?	43
3415	Zog	4	“Yes!” said Madam Dragon.	44
3416	Zog	5	“How to capture a princess!	45
3417	Zog	11	“Now that you’ve been shown, you can practise on your own.	46
3418	Zog	12	You’ll need to capture hundreds by the time you’re fully grown.” .	47
3419	Zog	5	Zog went off to practise.	48
3420	Zog	11	He tried and tried and tried, But he simply couldn’t manage.	49
3421	Zog	7	“I’m no good at this,” he cried.	50
3422	Zog	6	‘I’ll never win a golden star!”	51
3423	Zog	6	Just then he saw the girl.	52
3424	Zog	11	‘Perhaps,” she said, “you’d like to capture met I’m Princess Pearl.”	53
3425	Zog	6	“What a good idea!” said Zog.	54
3426	Zog	5	Then up and off t	55
3427	Zog	12	hey flew, The princess gripping tightly as they zigzagged through the blue.	56
3428	Zog	4	“Ah,” said Madam Dragon.	57
3429	Zog	5	“Our first princess so far!	58
3430	Zog	9	Congratulations, Zog, my dear; you’ve won a golden star!”	59
3431	Zog	11	Zog was proud and happy, and Pearl felt good as well.	60
3432	Zog	11	She took the dragons’ temperatures, and nursed them when they fell.	61
3433	Zog	13	A year went by and, in Year Five, the dragons learned to fight.	62
3434	Zog	4	“Right!” said Madam Dragon.	63
3435	Zog	6	“Here comes a real live knight!”	64
3436	Zog	13	Up spoke the knight: “ My name,” he said, “is Gadabout the Great.	65
3437	Zog	7	I’ve come to rescue Princ ess Pearl.	66
3438	Zog	7	■ I hope I’m not too late.	67
3439	Zog	7	Zog breathed fire and beat his wings.	68
3440	Zog	2	“You can’t!	69
3441	Zog	3	She’s m ine!”	70
3442	Zog	2	he roared.	71
3443	Zog	11	“Oh, no, she’s not!” yelled Gadabout, and waved his trusty sword.	72
3444	Zog	11	The other dragons crowded round and watched them , all agog.	73
3445	Zog	7	Who was going to win the fight.	74
3446	Zog	4	Sir Gadabout or Zog?	75
3447	Zog	11	Then Princess Pearl stepped forward, crying, “STOP, you sil ly chumps!	76
3448	Zog	12	The worlds already far too full of cuts and burns and bumps.	77
3449	Zog	3	Don’t rescue me!	78

3451	Zog	10	And prancing round the palace in a silly frilly dress.	80
3452	Zog	21	“I want to be a doc tor, and travel here and there, Listening to people’s chests and giving them my care.	81
3453	Zog	8	;M=, rao!- „daimed the and took h. offh.	82
3454	Zog	10	1 d rather wear a nice twisty stethoscope,” he said.	83
3455	Zog	6	“Perhaps, Princess, you’ll train me up?”	84
3456	Zog	20	And Pearl repli ed, “Of course, But I don’t see how the two of us could fit upon your horse.”	85
3457	Zog	5	Then Zog said, “Flying doctors!	86
3458	Zog	6	I’d love to join the crew.	87
3459	Zog	12	If you’ll let me be your ambulance, then I can carry you.”	88
3460	Zog	4	“Bravo!” said Madam Dragon.	89
3461	Zog	3	“An excellent career!”	90
3462	Zog	11	And all the Year Five dragons gave a loud resounding cheer.	91
3463	Zog	12	Then Madam Dragon told the horse, “I really hope you’ ll stay.	92
3464	Zog	13	I’ll let you be my pupils’ pet, and feed you lots of hay.”	93
3465	Zog	6	“What a good idea!” said Zog.	94
3466	Zog	16	Then up and off he flew, The Flying Doctors waving as they zigzagged through the blue.	95
3467	Lost in Snow	7	Ollie peeped out of the barn door.	0
3468	Lost in Snow	8	Something cold and wet plopped on his nose.	1
3469	Lost in Snow	8	“What’s all this white stuff, Mum? he squeaked.	2
3470	Lost in Snow	4	“Can you eat it?”	3
3471	Lost in Snow	6	“It’s snow, Ollie,” his mum laughed.	4
3472	Lost in Snow	6	“It falls like rain in winter.	5
3473	Lost in Snow	6	And no, you shouldn’t eat it.”	6
3474	Lost in Snow	8	“Can we play in it, then?” he asked.	7
3475	Lost in Snow	6	“Please, Mum,” cried Sheba and Sam.	8
3476	Lost in Snow	11	“Of course you can,” said Mum, “but don’t go too far.”	9
3477	Lost in Snow	10	Sam and Sheba skidded and slid across the icy farmyard.	10
3478	Lost in Snow	8	“Wait for me!” yelped Ollie, racing after them.	11
3479	Lost in Snow	10	When the puppies reached the field, they stopped and stared.	12
3480	Lost in Snow	4	There was snow everywhere.	13
3481	Lost in Snow	4	“Let’s play!” cried Ollie.	14
3482	Lost in Snow	16	The puppies chased and dug and rolled under the flying snowflakes, until suddenly . . .	15
3483	Lost in Snow	1	...	16
3484	Lost in Snow	21	a strange face loomed up in front of them - a face with a huge mouth, huge eyes and HUGE teeth!	17
3485	Lost in Snow	8	For a moment the puppies froze with fear.	18
3486	Lost in Snow	1	“RUN!”	19
3487	Lost in Snow	2	Sheba cried.	20
3488	Lost in Snow	8	The puppies rushed off through the flurrying snowflakes.	21
3489	Lost in Snow	23	Ollie’s paws scrabbled and skidded as he ran and ran, until at last the dog’s barks faded and everything was quiet and still.	22
3490	Lost in Snow	6	But where were Sheba and Sam?	23
3491	Lost in Snow	7	Where were the farmyard and the barn?	24
3492	Lost in Snow	4	“Oh no,” whimpered Ollie.	25
3493	Lost in Snow	2	“I’m lost!”	26
3494	Lost in Snow	13	“Too whit, too whoo, who are you?” hooted a voice high above him.	27
3495	Lost in Snow	3	Ollie looked up.	28
3496	Lost in Snow	6	Two big, round eyes stared down.	29
3497	Lost in Snow	16	“I’m Ollie and I’ve lost my family and I don’t know my way home,” Ollie squeaked.	30
3498	Lost in Snow	9	“Perhaps you should follow your footprints,” suggested the owl.	31
3499	Lost in Snow	14	“They’ll lead you home again - but hurry, or they’ll be covered in snow.”	32
3500	Lost in Snow	6	“Thank you so much!” said Ollie.	33
3501	Lost in Snow	3	“I’ll do that.”	34
3502	Lost in Snow	5	Tail wagging, he set off.	35
3503	Lost in Snow	19	But by the time he had reached the middle of the field, the footprints were disappearing under fresh snow.	36
3504	Lost in Snow	7	Soon Ollie couldn’t see them at all.	37
3505	Lost in Snow	10	He trudged on and on as the snow grew deeper.	38
3506	Lost in Snow	6	“I must keep going,” he panted.	39
3507	Lost in Snow	11	“I must get back to my nice, warm basket and supper.”	40
3508	Lost in Snow	7	At last Ollie reached a large wood.	41
3509	Lost in Snow	7	Was this the wood by his farm?	42
3510	Lost in Snow	8	If it was, then he was nearly home!	43
3511	Lost in Snow	11	The snow had stopped, and evening sunlight shone through the trees.	44
3512	Lost in Snow	8	Crunch, crunch, Ollie crept through the icy leaves.	45
3513	Lost in Snow	8	But then, all at once . . .	46
3514	Lost in Snow	1	Swoosh!	47
3515	Lost in Snow	11	Ollie slipped down an icy slope, tumbling over and over… THUMP!	48
3516	Lost in Snow	13	From the shadow of the bushes three fox cubs stared out at him.	49
3517	Lost in Snow	8	“Look what the snow’s blown in,” said one.	50
3518	Lost in Snow	5	“What a scruff!” said another.	51
3519	Lost in Snow	7	“This is our home,” said the third.	52
3520	Lost in Snow	2	“Clear off!”	53
3521	Lost in Snow	10	“But I don’t know which way to go!” cried Ollie.	54
3522	Lost in Snow	4	Sadly he walked away.	55
3523	Lost in Snow	9	He would have to find his own way home.	56
3524	Lost in Snow	14	Ollie reached the edge of the wood, but still he couldn’t see the farm.	57
3525	Lost in Snow	6	He tried to cheer himself up.	58
3526	Lost in Snow	13	He’d have so much to tell Sam and Sheba when he reached home!	59
3527	Lost in Snow	10	But the snow was falling once more, thicker and faster.	60
3528	Lost in Snow	15	As he struggled on, Ollie began to think he would never see his family again.	61
3529	Lost in Snow	11	Cold, hungry, and very, very tired, Ollie crawled under a bush.	62
3530	Lost in Snow	12	A mouse scurried past his feet and disappeared into a small hole.	63
3531	Lost in Snow	14	“I wish I could find somewhere safe and warm to sleep, too,” Ollie sighed.	64
3532	Lost in Snow	12	But as he closed his eyes, he heard something . . .	65
3533	Lost in Snow	2	“Ollie! OLLIE!	66
3534	Lost in Snow	3	Where are you?”	67
3535	Lost in Snow	10	Ollie peeped out from the bush - it was Mum!	68
3536	Lost in Snow	2	“Mum! Sam!	69
3537	Lost in Snow	1	Sheba!	70
3538	Lost in Snow	3	I’m over here!”	71
3539	Lost in Snow	10	And across the frozen field Ollie raced to meet them.	72
3540	Lost in Snow	9	“We’ve been looking for you for hours,” cried Mum.	73
3541	Lost in Snow	4	“Where have you been?”	74
3542	Lost in Snow	6	“I’ve had an adventure,” said Ollie.	75
3543	Lost in Snow	7	“But I’m so glad it’s over now.”	76
3544	Lost in Snow	10	“So am I,” said Mum, gently licking his freezing ears.	77
3545	Lost in Snow	15	Home at last, Ollie curled up with his brother and sister in their cosy bed.	78
3546	Lost in Snow	10	The puppies wanted to know all about Ollie’s Big Adventure.	79
3547	Lost in Snow	8	“Tell us more about the owl!” cried Sheba.	80
3548	Lost in Snow	7	“And the nasty fox cubs!” squeaked Sam.	81
3549	Lost in Snow	14	But, warm and snug, his tummy full of dinner, Ollie had fallen fast asleep.	82
3550	Monkey Needs to Listen	5	Mr Croc was very busy.	0
3551	Monkey Needs to Listen	8	He was in the shed at Jungle School.	1
3552	Monkey Needs to Listen	14	He was trying to think of some good ideas for the After School Club.	2
3553	Monkey Needs to Listen	10	Mr Croc was in charge of the After School Club.	3
3554	Monkey Needs to Listen	13	He liked to think of interesting and exciting things for everyone to do.	4
3555	Monkey Needs to Listen	8	He found some old wheels and some wood.	5
3556	Monkey Needs to Listen	10	The wheels and the wood gave him a good idea.	6
3557	Monkey Needs to Listen	7	He went to tell everyone about it.	7
3558	Monkey Needs to Listen	10	Mr Croc told everyone to sit still and to listen.	8
3559	Monkey Needs to Listen	6	Everyone sat still and listened carefully.	9
3560	Monkey Needs to Listen	11	But Monkey did not sit still and he did not listen.	10
3561	Monkey Needs to Listen	7	Mr Croc told everyone his good idea.	11
3562	Monkey Needs to Listen	10	He told them they were going to work in teams.	12
3563	Monkey Needs to Listen	17	He said each team was going to build a go-kart out of the wood and the wheels.	13
3564	Monkey Needs to Listen	16	He said that when the go- karts were finished, they would race them round the swamp.	14
3565	Monkey Needs to Listen	11	Then Mr Croc asked who would like to drive the go-karts.	15
3566	Monkey Needs to Listen	5	Everyone wanted to drive them.	16
3567	Monkey Needs to Listen	5	Everyone put up their hands.	17
3568	Monkey Needs to Listen	6	Mr Croc had a good idea.	18
3569	Monkey Needs to Listen	7	He put everyone's names in a hat.	19
3570	Monkey Needs to Listen	6	First he pulled out Elephant's name.	20
3571	Monkey Needs to Listen	4	Elephant was very excited.	21
3572	Monkey Needs to Listen	6	Then he pulled out Monkey's name.	22
3573	Monkey Needs to Listen	12	He told Monkey that he was going to drive a go-kart, too.	23
3574	Monkey Needs to Listen	4	Monkey was very excited.	24
3575	Monkey Needs to Listen	11	Mr Croc said that everyone needed to listen to the instructions.	25
3576	Monkey Needs to Listen	8	He said it was important to listen carefully.	26
3577	Monkey Needs to Listen	9	He said everyone had to work as a team.	27
3578	Monkey Needs to Listen	9	They had to work together to build the go-karts.	28
3579	Monkey Needs to Listen	12	He said they had to check they were safe to race, too.	29
3580	Monkey Needs to Listen	3	Everyone listened carefully.	30
3581	Monkey Needs to Listen	7	But Monkey did not listen at all.	31
3582	Monkey Needs to Listen	9	Then Mr Croc gave everyone special jobs to do.	32
3583	Monkey Needs to Listen	6	Lion had to build the go-kart.	33
3584	Monkey Needs to Listen	7	Hippo had to put on the wheels.	34
3585	Monkey Needs to Listen	8	Little Lion had to fix the steering wheel.	35
3586	Monkey Needs to Listen	10	Monkey had to check the wheels and the steering wheel.	36
3587	Monkey Needs to Listen	19	Mr Croc said it was important to check them carefully to make sure the go-kart was safe to race.	37
3588	Monkey Needs to Listen	5	But Monkey did not listen.	38
3589	Monkey Needs to Listen	5	Soon the go-kart was ready.	39
3590	Monkey Needs to Listen	9	Hippo had to remind Monkey to check the wheels.	40
3591	Monkey Needs to Listen	5	But Monkey did not listen.	41
3592	Monkey Needs to Listen	11	Little Lion had to remind Monkey to check the steering wheel.	42
3593	Monkey Needs to Listen	5	But Monkey did not listen.	43
3594	Monkey Needs to Listen	8	Soon it was the day of the race.	44
3595	Monkey Needs to Listen	3	Everyone was excited.	45
3596	Monkey Needs to Listen	8	Monkey and Elephant lined up at the start.	46
3597	Monkey Needs to Listen	10	Mr Croc said they needed to listen to the instructions.	47
3598	Monkey Needs to Listen	14	He told them not to go too fast round the corner of the swamp.	48
3599	Monkey Needs to Listen	5	But Monkey did not listen.	49
3600	Monkey Needs to Listen	6	He sped off in his go-kart.	50
3601	Monkey Needs to Listen	10	Monkey went too fast round the corner of the swamp.	51
3602	Monkey Needs to Listen	13	The wheels began to wobble ... and the steering wheel began to shake!	52
3603	Monkey Needs to Listen	6	Suddenly the steering wheel broke off.	53
3604	Monkey Needs to Listen	5	The go-kart began to Skid.	54
3605	Monkey Needs to Listen	7	Then it shot up into the air.	55
3606	Monkey Needs to Listen	8	It spun round and round and then ...	56
3607	Monkey Needs to Listen	9	it shot into the swamp with a loud PLOP!	57
3608	Monkey Needs to Listen	5	Everyone ran to help Monkey.	58
3609	Monkey Needs to Listen	7	They pulled him out of the swamp.	59
3610	Monkey Needs to Listen	6	He was very wet and smelly.	60
3611	Monkey Needs to Listen	6	Then they pulled out the go-kart.	61
3612	Monkey Needs to Listen	5	It was bent and twisted.	62
3613	Monkey Needs to Listen	4	Mr Croc was cross.	63
3614	Monkey Needs to Listen	4	"“Monkey needs to listen!"""	64
3615	Monkey Needs to Listen	2	everyone said.	65
3616	Monkey Needs to Listen	8	Monkey was sorry that he had not listened.	66
3617	Monkey Needs to Listen	14	He was sorry that he had not checked the wheels and the steering wheel.	67
3618	Monkey Needs to Listen	9	He was sorry that he had gone too fast.	68
3619	Monkey Needs to Listen	16	Worst of all, he was sorry that he had crashed and spoilt the race for everyone.	69
3620	Monkey Needs to Listen	6	Then Elephant had a good idea.	70
3621	Monkey Needs to Listen	12	He asked Mr Croc if everyone could help mend Monkey's go- kart.	71
3622	Monkey Needs to Listen	13	He asked if they could race the go-karts again when it was mended.	72
3623	Monkey Needs to Listen	9	Mr Croc said it was a very good idea.	73
3624	Monkey Needs to Listen	6	Everyone helped to mend Monkey's go-kart.	74
3625	Monkey Needs to Listen	6	Everyone worked together as a team.	75
3626	Monkey Needs to Listen	5	This time Monkey listened carefully.	76
3627	Monkey Needs to Listen	11	Hippo did not have to remind him to check the wheels.	77
3628	Monkey Needs to Listen	3	He was pleased.	78
3629	Monkey Needs to Listen	13	Little Lion did not have to remind Monkey to check the steering wheel.	79
3630	Monkey Needs to Listen	3	He was pleased.	80
3631	Monkey Needs to Listen	8	Soon it was time to race the go-karts.	81
3632	Monkey Needs to Listen	3	Everyone was excited.	82
3633	Monkey Needs to Listen	8	Monkey and Elephant lined up at the start.	83
3634	Monkey Needs to Listen	10	Mr Croc told everyone to listen carefully to the instructions.	84
3635	Monkey Needs to Listen	14	He told them not to drive too fast round the corner of the swamp.	85
3636	Monkey Needs to Listen	4	This time Monkey listened.	86
3637	Monkey Needs to Listen	3	Monkey raced hard.	87
3638	Monkey Needs to Listen	15	But this time he did not go too fast round the corner of the swamp.	88
3639	Monkey Needs to Listen	14	This time the wheels did not wobble and the steering wheel did not shake.	89
3640	Monkey Needs to Listen	8	Best of all the go-kart did not skid.	90
3641	Monkey Needs to Listen	9	Monkey and Elephant raced over the finish line together.	91
3642	Monkey Needs to Listen	4	Everyone clapped and cheered!	92

3672	Gordon's Great Escape	6	... into a BIG stripy tent.	29

3674	Gordon's Great Escape	8	Oh, how he loved being a circus balloon.	31
3675	Gordon's Great Escape	7	He wasn’t at all scared of heights.	32

3680	Gordon's Great Escape	14	“My friends have never let me down - so I can’t let THEM down!”	37
3681	Gordon's Great Escape	9	he said, as he flew through wind and rain.	38

3683	Gordon's Great Escape	7	How would he ever find help now?	40
3684	Gordon's Great Escape	8	As luck would have it, help found him!	41
3685	Gordon's Great Escape	11	Together they rescued Gordon’s friends... and headed back for dry land.	42
3686	Gordon's Great Escape	17	A crowd of people - even the mayor - had gathered to meet the brave little balloon.	43

3697	Gordon's Great Escape	7	He was so happy, he could BURST!	54
3698	Dogger	9	Once there was a soft brown toy called Dogger.	0
3699	Dogger	11	One of his ears pointed upwards and the other flopped over.	1
3700	Dogger	11	His fur was worn in places because he was quite old.	2
3701	Dogger	4	He belonged to Dave.	3
3702	Dogger	6	Dave was very fond of Dogger.	4
3703	Dogger	4	He took him everywhere.	5
3704	Dogger	8	Sometimes he gave him rides in a trolley.	6
3705	Dogger	15	Sometimes he pulled him along on a lead made of string like a real dog.	7
3706	Dogger	13	When it was cold he wrapped him up in a bit of blanket.	8
3707	Dogger	13	Now and again Dave’s Mum said that Dogger was getting much too dirty.	9
3708	Dogger	13	She showed Dave how to wash him in a bowl of soapy water.	10
3709	Dogger	13	Then they hung him up by his tail on the washing-line to dry.	11
3710	Dogger	7	Dave’s baby brother, Joe, liked hard toys.	12
3711	Dogger	16	He liked putting them in his mouth and biting on them, because he was getting teeth.	13
3712	Dogger	13	Dave’s big sister, Bella, took seven teddies to bed with her every night.	14
3713	Dogger	15	She had to sleep right up against the wall to stop herself from falling out.	15
3714	Dogger	5	But Dave liked only Dogger.	16
3715	Dogger	12	One afternoon Dave and Mum set out to collect Bella from school.	17
3716	Dogger	10	Mum took Joe in the pushchair and Dave took Dogger.	18
3717	Dogger	12	Next to the school gate where the mums waited was a playing-field.	19
3718	Dogger	9	Some men with ladders were putting up coloured flags.	20
3719	Dogger	20	Mum said that there was going to be a Summer Fair to get money to buy things for the school.	21
3720	Dogger	14	Dave pushed Dogger up against the railings to show him what was going on.	22
3721	Dogger	10	Just then the children started to come out of school.	23
3722	Dogger	10	An ice-cream van came round the corner playing a tune.	24
3723	Dogger	7	Bella ran up with her satchel flying.	25
3724	Dogger	6	“Mum, can we have an ice-cream?”	26
3725	Dogger	8	Mum gave her the money for two cones.	27
3726	Dogger	13	Joe didn’t have a whole ice-cream to himself because he was too dribbly.	28
3727	Dogger	16	On the way home Dave walked beside the pushchair giving Joe licks off his ice- cream.	29
3728	Dogger	11	Joe kicked his feet about and shouted for more in-between licks.	30
3729	Dogger	6	At tea-time Dave was rather quiet.	31
3730	Dogger	7	In the bath he was even quieter.	32
3731	Dogger	7	At bed-time he said: “I want Dogger.”	33
3732	Dogger	7	But Dogger was nowhere to be found.	34
3733	Dogger	5	Mum looked under the bed.	35
3734	Dogger	5	She looked behind the cupboard.	36
3735	Dogger	9	She searched in the kitchen— —and underneath the stairs.	37
3736	Dogger	6	Dave watched anxiously through the banisters.	38
3737	Dogger	8	Joe watched through the bars of his cot.	39
3738	Dogger	7	Bella joined in to look for Dogger.	40
3739	Dogger	15	She turned out her own toy-box in case he was in there, but he wasn’t.	41
3740	Dogger	9	When Dad came home he looked for Dogger too.	42
3741	Dogger	13	He searched in the shed and down the garden path with a torch.	43
3742	Dogger	5	But Dogger was quite lost.	44
3743	Dogger	9	Dave was very sad when he went to bed.	45
3744	Dogger	22	Bella kindly lent him one of her teddies to go to sleep with but it was not the same thing as Dogger.	46
3745	Dogger	10	Dave kept waking up in the night and missing him.	47
3746	Dogger	7	Bella joined in to look for Dogger.	48
3747	Dogger	15	She turned out her own toy-box in case he was in there, but he wasn’t.	49
3748	Dogger	9	When Dad came home he looked for Dogger too.	50
3749	Dogger	13	He searched in the shed and down the garden path with a torch.	51
3750	Dogger	5	But Dogger was quite lost.	52
3751	Dogger	9	Dave was very sad when he went to bed.	53
3752	Dogger	22	Bella kindly lent him one of her teddies to go to sleep with but it was not the same thing as Dogger.	54
3753	Dogger	10	Dave kept waking up in the night and missing him.	55
3754	Dogger	14	The next day was Saturday and they all went to the School Summer Fair.	56
3755	Dogger	8	The playing-field was full of stalls and side-shows.	57
3756	Dogger	6	There was a Fancy Dress Parade.	58
3757	Dogger	15	Then there were Sports, with an Egg-and-Spoon Race— a Wheelbarrow Race and a Fathers’ Race.	59
3758	Dogger	6	Bella was very good at races.	60
3759	Dogger	9	She won the Three-Legged Race with her friend Barbara.	61
3760	Dogger	9	“Wouldn’t you like to go in for a race?”	62
3761	Dogger	3	they asked Dave.	63
3762	Dogger	6	But Dave didn’t feel like racing.	64
3763	Dogger	6	He was missing Dogger too much.	65
3764	Dogger	8	Then another very exciting thing happened to Bella.	66
3765	Dogger	7	She won first prize in a Raffle!	67
3766	Dogger	13	It was a huge yellow Teddy Bear, wearing a beautiful blue silk bow.	68
3767	Dogger	7	He was almost as big as Dave.	69
3768	Dogger	7	Dave didn’t like that Teddy at all.	70
3769	Dogger	15	At that moment he didn’t like Bella much either because she kept on winning things.	71
3770	Dogger	11	He went off on his own to look at the stalls.	72
3771	Dogger	17	One lady had a Toy Stall, full of knitted ducks and cars and baby dolls in bonnets.	73
3772	Dogger	17	And there, at the very back of the stall, behind a lot of other toys, was DOGGER!	74
3773	Dogger	7	He was wearing a ticket saying “5p”.	75
3774	Dogger	9	There were a lot of people round the stall.	76
3775	Dogger	29	Dave tried to explain to the lady that it was his Dogger, who had got lost and somehow been put on the stall by mistake, but she wasn’t listening.	77
3776	Dogger	5	He looked in his pocket.	78
3777	Dogger	7	He had 3p but that wasn’t enough.	79
3778	Dogger	16	He ran to find Mum and Dad to ask them to buy Dogger back at once.	80
3779	Dogger	13	Dave went everywhere in the crowd but he couldn’t see Mum and Dad.	81
3780	Dogger	7	He thought he was going to cry.	82
3781	Dogger	8	At last he found Bella by the cakes.	83
3782	Dogger	19	When she heard about Dogger, she and Dave ran back to the Toy Stall as fast as they could.	84
3783	Dogger	5	But something terrible had happened.	85
3784	Dogger	9	Dogger had just been bought by a little girl!	86
3785	Dogger	7	She was already walking off with him.	87
3786	Dogger	4	Dave began to cry.	88
3787	Dogger	21	Bella ran after her and tried to explain that Dogger really belonged to Dave, and could they please buy him back?	89
3788	Dogger	6	But the little girl said: “No.”	90
3789	Dogger	15	She said that she had bought Dogger with her own money and she wanted him.	91
3790	Dogger	7	She held on to him very tightly.	92
3791	Dogger	4	Dave cried and cried.	93
3792	Dogger	8	And the little girl started to cry too.	94
3793	Dogger	16	But out of the corner of her eye she caught sight of Bella’s big yellow Teddy.	95
3794	Dogger	15	She stopped crying and put out her hand to stroke his beautiful blue silk bow.	96
3795	Dogger	6	Then Bella did something very kind.	97
3796	Dogger	10	“Would you swop this Teddy for my brother’s dog, then?”	98
3797	Dogger	2	she asked.	99
3798	Dogger	11	Right away the little girl stopped crying and began to smile.	100
3799	Dogger	19	She held out Dogger to Dave, took the big Teddy instead and went off with him in her arms.	101
3800	Dogger	4	Then Dave smiled too.	102
3801	Dogger	10	He hugged Dogger and he hugged Bella round the waist.	103
3802	Dogger	5	“Thank you, Bella,” he said.	104
3803	Dogger	9	That night Dave had Dogger in bed beside him.	105
3804	Dogger	4	Bella was practising somersaults.	106
3805	Dogger	6	“Shall you miss that big Teddy?”	107
3806	Dogger	3	Dave asked her.	108
3807	Dogger	9	“No,” said Bella, “I didn’t like him much really.	109
3808	Dogger	10	He was too big and his eyes were too staring.	110
3809	Dogger	15	Anyway if I had another Teddy in my bed there wouldn’t be room for me.”	111

3841	Wide-awake Hedgehog	10	The evenings were darkening and the leaves were turning gold.	0
3842	Wide-awake Hedgehog	13	It was the time when hedgehogs should be settling for their winter sleep.	1
3843	Wide-awake Hedgehog	8	But Isaac the hedgehog was NOT feeling sleepy.	2
3844	Wide-awake Hedgehog	4	Isaac wanted to play.	3
3845	Wide-awake Hedgehog	6	But who would play with Isaac?	4
3846	Wide-awake Hedgehog	4	"""Play?” asked the squirrels."	5
3847	Wide-awake Hedgehog	3	"""What a suggestion!"	6
3848	Wide-awake Hedgehog	9	We are too busy storing food for such nonsense.	7
3849	Wide-awake Hedgehog	9	Go to sleep Prickly One, cold winter is coming!”	8
3850	Wide-awake Hedgehog	6	But Isaac was NOT feeling sleepy.	9
3851	Wide-awake Hedgehog	12	“No time for play, we are off, off, off,” chirped the swallows.	10
3852	Wide-awake Hedgehog	7	“We must fly south to the warm.	11
3853	Wide-awake Hedgehog	19	You go too, go to bed, Mister Isaac, go to bed or you will catch cold in the winter.”	12
3854	Wide-awake Hedgehog	14	But Isaac was not cold, and he did not want to go to bed.	13
3855	Wide-awake Hedgehog	4	Isaac wanted to play.	14
3856	Wide-awake Hedgehog	16	"""Play?” yawned the dormouse, ""Of course yes, yes, certainly we must, I'D. be right with you.”"	15
3857	Wide-awake Hedgehog	1	"""Mmmmm."	16
3858	Wide-awake Hedgehog	10	Wait one minute, just one minute and Ill... be...rgnughh... ...	17
3859	Wide-awake Hedgehog	2	I’ll be...	18
3860	Wide-awake Hedgehog	7	Sxgiugh, sssxxxksxugh...” and he started to snore.	19
3861	Wide-awake Hedgehog	4	“Oh dear,” thought Isaac.	20
3862	Wide-awake Hedgehog	5	‘I only want some fun.	21
3863	Wide-awake Hedgehog	5	Will nobody play with me?”	22
3864	Wide-awake Hedgehog	11	Just then he heard a whisper close up in his ear.	23
3865	Wide-awake Hedgehog	10	“Issssssaaacc, I will give you one last play before winter.”	24
3866	Wide-awake Hedgehog	8	Isaac jumped up, but no one was there.	25
3867	Wide-awake Hedgehog	3	"""Where are you?”"	26
3868	Wide-awake Hedgehog	2	He cried.	27
3869	Wide-awake Hedgehog	5	“Shhhh h,” went the whisper.	28
3870	Wide-awake Hedgehog	3	“I am everywhere.”	29
3871	Wide-awake Hedgehog	11	But though Isaac looked he could see no one at all.	30
3872	Wide-awake Hedgehog	3	"""Where are you?"	31
3873	Wide-awake Hedgehog	3	Who are you?	32
3874	Wide-awake Hedgehog	4	Come out and play!”	33
3875	Wide-awake Hedgehog	9	“I am the one who makes the trees dance.	34
3876	Wide-awake Hedgehog	5	I help the ravens hover.	35
3877	Wide-awake Hedgehog	10	I rustle up the grass and whip up the clouds.	36
3878	Wide-awake Hedgehog	9	And now, too, I shall play with you Isaac.	37
3879	Wide-awake Hedgehog	9	Hold up a finger, then you shall feel me.”	38
3880	Wide-awake Hedgehog	5	"""Is that you, North Wind?”"	39
3881	Wide-awake Hedgehog	1	“Yesssss!”	40
3882	Wide-awake Hedgehog	2	she rustled.	41
3883	Wide-awake Hedgehog	13	“And though I am strong and you are small we shall play together.”	42
3884	Wide-awake Hedgehog	4	She held her breath.	43
3885	Wide-awake Hedgehog	8	“Are you maybe too small to play catch-a-leaf?”	44
3886	Wide-awake Hedgehog	8	Isaac was NOT too small for this game.	45
3887	Wide-awake Hedgehog	21	Wind threw the leaves up and Isaac leapt and he tumbled and snatched at them falling until he was quite pink.	46
3888	Wide-awake Hedgehog	5	But catch them he did.	47
3889	Wide-awake Hedgehog	5	"""Tut tut” smirked the squirrels."	48
3890	Wide-awake Hedgehog	20	"""That is surety no way to behave before bedtime,” and they scurried off out of the breeze to their shelters."	49
3891	Wide-awake Hedgehog	14	“So,” said the wind, “it seems you are not too small for that game.	50
3892	Wide-awake Hedgehog	9	But are you too quiet for the roaring game?”	51
3893	Wide-awake Hedgehog	8	Isaac was NOT too quiet for this game.	52
3894	Wide-awake Hedgehog	18	Isaac roared at the wind, and she roared back in his ears until both their voices were spent.	53
3895	Wide-awake Hedgehog	15	Nor was Isaac too slow for the spin-round-and- round game, though Wind tickled his nose.	54
3896	Wide-awake Hedgehog	25	When at last Isaac got tired he lay on his back and looked at the sky while Wind drew pictures for him with the clouds.	55
3897	Wide-awake Hedgehog	17	"""Wind,” said Isaac, ""I wish I could See you, ""and I wish I Could hold you, too.”"	56
3898	Wide-awake Hedgehog	2	Wind sighed.	57
3899	Wide-awake Hedgehog	19	“But, Spiny One, some of the best things can neither be seen nor be held, yet they are real.”	58
3900	Wide-awake Hedgehog	4	"""Like happiness?” yawned Isaac."	59
3901	Wide-awake Hedgehog	4	“Like happiness,” smiled Wind.	60
3902	Wide-awake Hedgehog	3	“And sleepiness too.	61
3903	Wide-awake Hedgehog	7	Come little friend, cold winter is coming.”	62
3904	Wide-awake Hedgehog	8	Wind ushered Isaac to his pile of leaves.	63
3905	Wide-awake Hedgehog	18	“What a nice play we had,” she whispered, “but now it is time for your long winter sleep.	64
3906	Wide-awake Hedgehog	14	When you wake it shall be spring and the world will be growing again.”	65
3907	Wide-awake Hedgehog	6	“I’m really not sleepy’’ said Isaac.	66
3908	Wide-awake Hedgehog	6	"""Will you sing to me, Wind?”"	67
3909	Wide-awake Hedgehog	17	So Wind whistled around him while Isaac snuggled up warm and waited for sleep, and for spring.	68
3910	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	11	Doug and Trevor had been best friends for a long time.	0
3911	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	11	They played together every day and didn't like to be apart.	1

3916	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	9	“You always say it's my turn when it's not.	6
3917	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	7	"I don’t want to play any more."""	7
3918	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	3	"“Fine,"" said Trevor."	8
3919	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	11	And he turned away in a huff But just then.. ...	9
3920	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	10	a great big shovel came down and scooped Doug up.	10
3921	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	2	Oh no!	11
3922	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	5	What on earth was happening?	12
3923	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	3	"“Doug!"" cried Trevor."	13
3924	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	3	Trevor! cried Doug.	14
3925	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	11	When he finally opened his eyes, Doug got quite a surprise.	15
3926	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	3	TREVOBT he yelled.	16
3927	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	1	“HELP!”	17
3928	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	9	But Trevor was too far away to hear him.	18
3929	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	7	"I’ve got to get home,"" thought Doug."	19
3930	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	2	But how?	20
3931	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	9	Then he heard a funny noise, Bzzzz, bzzzz, bump!	21
3932	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	7	It was a v ery dizzy fly.	22
3933	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	8	He was banging his head against the window.	23
3934	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	3	Bzzzz, bzzzz, bump!	24
3935	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	12	"""Erm, maybe you should the the door,"" said Doug, politely “The door?"	25
3936	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	2	Great idea!	26
3937	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	6	Why didn’t I think of that?	27
3938	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	6	I’ve be en here for days.	28
3939	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	15	Oh, how can I ever thank you?” said the fly Doug tried not to laugh.	29
3940	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	11	“Well,” he sai d, “maybe you could take me with you?”	30
3941	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	9	“I’ll try,” said the fly “You look quite heavy.	31
3942	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	3	But here goes!”	32
3943	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	3	Bzzzz, bzzzz... ...whoa!	33
3944	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	7	"“Don’t drop me in there!"" cried Doug."	34

3946	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	1	whey!	36
3947	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	3	“Or on there!”	37

3949	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	6	“And definitely don’t drop me THERE!”	39
3950	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	1	Phew!	40
3951	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	3	That was dose.	41
3952	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	7	But the fly was starting to wobble.	42
3953	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	2	“Don’t... think...	43
3954	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	4	I... can... hold... on..	44
3955	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	4	And. then - PLOP!	45
3956	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	6	Doug landed, SPLAT, in somebody’s breakfast.	46
3957	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	15	He was ju st wondering if things could get any worse - when they did.	47
3958	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	10	Pepper sprinkled onto his nose and— aah, aaah, aaaah... …	48
3959	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	1	choo!	49
3960	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	14	Doug shot through the air and span round and round on the ceiling fan.	50
3961	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	2	Then Boing!	51
3962	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	26	He bounced off a spon ge cake and popped up a pedal bin ft which sent him spin ning through the air- ... towards the toaster.	52
3963	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	1	Ping!	53
3964	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	9	He smashed through the toast and began to fall.	54
3965	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	23	He grabbed the first thing he could and swung – aargh! – all the way back… ... to exactly where he had started.	55
3966	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	9	Doug had to admit things weren’t going very well.	56
3967	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	18	“Will I ever see Trevor again?” he said, sadly Then he heard a familiar sound... “Bzzzz, bzzzz, byeeeee!”	57
3968	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	2	it called.	58
3969	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	8	It was the fly, buzzing out of sight.	59
3970	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	12	A nd that was when Doug noticed that the window... WAS OPEN!	60
3971	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	4	“Hey! Wait for me!”	61
3972	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	3	h e called.	62
3973	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	8	How was he going to get out now?	63
3974	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	6	Then Doug had an idea... “Weeeee!	64
3975	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	1	Home	65
3976	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	4	"I go!"" cried Doug."	66
3977	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	10	The friends were so happy to see each other again.	67
3978	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	18	“I’m sorry I wouldn’t g et the ball,” said Trevor “I’m sorry I got so cross,” said Doug.	68
3979	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	5	“Tell you what,” said Trevor.	69
3980	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	10	"""How about a gam e of Berry Ball right now?”"	70
3981	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	4	“You’re on!” said Doug.	71
3982	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	5	And all was well until...	72
3983	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	2	oh no!	73
3984	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	3	It happened again!	74
3985	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	4	Doug looked at Trevor.	75
3986	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	4	Trevor looked at Doug.	76
3987	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	9	“I’ll get it,” said Trevor “Let me,” said Doug.	77
3988	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	8	No, no, it’s definitely my turn,” said Trevor	78
3989	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	12	And they were so busy arguing, they didn’t hear a familiar sound.	79
3990	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	6	Bzzzz, bzzzz... “CATCH-1” said the fly.	80
3991	Doug The Bug That Went Boing	10	And they all played happily till the sun went down.	81
3992	Tyrannosaurus Drip	24	In a swamp beside a river, where the land was thick with veg, Lived a herd of duckbill dinosaurs who roamed the water’s edge.	0
3993	Tyrannosaurus Drip	6	And they hooted, “Up with rivers!”	1
3994	Tyrannosaurus Drip	6	and they hooted, “Up with reeds!”	2
3995	Tyrannosaurus Drip	10	And they hooted, “Up with bellyfuls of juicy water weeds!”	3
3996	Tyrannosaurus Drip	21	Now across the rushy river, on a hill the other side, Lived a mean Tyrannosaurus with his grim and grisly bride.	4
3997	Tyrannosaurus Drip	6	And they shouted, “Up with hunting!”	5
3998	Tyrannosaurus Drip	6	and they shouted, “Up with war!”	6
3999	Tyrannosaurus Drip	9	And they shouted, “Up with bellyfuls of duckbill dinosaur!”	7
4000	Tyrannosaurus Drip	18	But the two Tyrannosauruses, so grisly, mean and grim, Couldn’t catch the duckbill dinosaurs because they couldn’t swim.	8
4001	Tyrannosaurus Drip	6	And they muttered, “Down with water!”	9
4002	Tyrannosaurus Drip	6	and they muttered, “Down with wet!”	10
4003	Tyrannosaurus Drip	11	And they muttered, “What a shame that bridges aren’t invented yet.”	11
4004	Tyrannosaurus Drip	11	Now a little Compsognathus (but for short we’ll call her Comp)	12
4005	Tyrannosaurus Drip	13	Found a duckbill egg and stole it from a nest beside the swamp.	13
4006	Tyrannosaurus Drip	13	And she swam with it, and ran with it, And murmured, “Clever me!”	14
4007	Tyrannosaurus Drip	12	And, “Won’t the baby Comps Be thrilled with duckbill egg for... “…T!”	15
4008	Tyrannosaurus Drip	22	She dropped the egg in terror and went running for her life From the mean Tyrannosaurus and his grim and grisly wife.	16
4009	Tyrannosaurus Drip	23	And the duckbill egg went rolling, and at last it came to rest In – of all unlikely places – the Tyrannosaurus nest.	17
4010	Tyrannosaurus Drip	24	Now the mother T had great big jaws and great enormous legs, But her brain was rather little and she couldn't count her eggs.	18
4011	Tyrannosaurus Drip	22	"And she sang, ""Hatch out, my terrors, with your scaly little tails And your spikey little toothies and your scary little nails.”"	19
4012	Tyrannosaurus Drip	20	Out hatched Babies One and Two, as perfect as could be, But Mother T was horrified by Baby Number Three.	20
4013	Tyrannosaurus Drip	12	And she grumbled, “He looks weedy,” and she grumbled, “He looks weak.”	21
4014	Tyrannosaurus Drip	15	And she grumbled, “What long arms - and look, his mouth is like a beak!”	22
4015	Tyrannosaurus Drip	13	"""He just needs feeding up,” said Dad and gave the babes some meat."	23
4016	Tyrannosaurus Drip	12	The first two gulped and guzzled but the third refused to eat.	24
4017	Tyrannosaurus Drip	12	And he said, “I’m really sorry” and he said, “I simply can’t.”	25
4018	Tyrannosaurus Drip	7	And he said, “This meat looks horrible.	26
4019	Tyrannosaurus Drip	5	I’d rather eat a plant.”	27
4020	Tyrannosaurus Drip	3	“A PLANT!” yelled.	28
4021	Tyrannosaurus Drip	9	Mum in horror, and Dad said, “Get a grip!”	29
4022	Tyrannosaurus Drip	9	His sisters found a name for him: “Tyrannosaurus Drip!”	30
4023	Tyrannosaurus Drip	6	And they shouted, “Up with hunting!”	31
4024	Tyrannosaurus Drip	6	and they shouted, “Up with war!”	32
4025	Tyrannosaurus Drip	9	And they shouted, “Up with bellyfuls of duckbill dinosaur!”	33
4026	Tyrannosaurus Drip	21	Poor Tyrannosaurus Drip tried hard to sing along But the others yelled, “You silly, drip, you’ve got the words all wrong!”	34
4027	Tyrannosaurus Drip	6	For he hooted, “Down with hunting!”	35
4028	Tyrannosaurus Drip	6	and he hooted, “Down with war!”	36
4029	Tyrannosaurus Drip	9	And he hooted, “Down with bellyfuls of duckbill dinosaur!”	37
4030	Tyrannosaurus Drip	26	Drip’s sisters soon grew big enough to hunt with Dad and Mum But they turned on Drip and told him, “You’re not fierce enough to come.”	38
4031	Tyrannosaurus Drip	7	And he cried, “They’ve gone without me!”	39
4032	Tyrannosaurus Drip	4	and he cried, “Alackaday!”	40
4033	Tyrannosaurus Drip	8	And he cried, “This doesn’t feel like home.	41
4034	Tyrannosaurus Drip	5	I’m going to run away!”	42
4035	Tyrannosaurus Drip	22	So he ran off to the river, where he saw a lovely sight; A herd of duckbill dinosaurs, all hooting with delight.	43
4036	Tyrannosaurus Drip	6	And they hooted, “Up with rivers!”	44
4037	Tyrannosaurus Drip	6	and they hooted, “Up with reeds!”	45
4038	Tyrannosaurus Drip	10	And they hooted, “Up with bellyfuls of Juicy water weeds!”	46
4039	Tyrannosaurus Drip	26	As he stood there on the bank, a sudden urge took hold of him, And he jumped into the water ... and discovered he could SWIM!	47
4040	Tyrannosaurus Drip	19	And the duckbills came to greet him by the rushy river’s edge And they hooted, “Nice to see you!”	48
4041	Tyrannosaurus Drip	6	and they hooted, “Have some veg!”	49
4042	Tyrannosaurus Drip	21	And Drip, who was delighted that they hadn’t run away, Ate bellyfuls of water weeds, and played with them all day.	50
4043	Tyrannosaurus Drip	19	Then he gazed into the river and he asked them, “Who, oh who Is that creature in the water?”	51
4044	Tyrannosaurus Drip	7	And they laughed and said, “It’s you!”	52
4045	Tyrannosaurus Drip	12	That night the lightning crackled and a storm blew down a tree.	53
4046	Tyrannosaurus Drip	12	And it fell across the river, and the Ts cried out, ‘Yippee!”	54
4047	Tyrannosaurus Drip	6	And they shouted, “Up with hunting!”	55
4048	Tyrannosaurus Drip	6	and they shouted, “Up with war!”	56
4049	Tyrannosaurus Drip	9	And they shouted, “Up with bellyfuls of duckbill dinosaur!”	57
4050	Tyrannosaurus Drip	23	"Drip’s sisters stepped onto the Bridge, but then began to frown, For there in front of them stood Drip, who yelled, ""Look out!"	58
4051	Tyrannosaurus Drip	2	Look DOWN!”	59
4052	Tyrannosaurus Drip	18	And they looked into the water, and they each let out a yelp, And one cried, “Water monsters!”	60
4053	Tyrannosaurus Drip	6	And the other one cried, “HELP!”	61
4054	Tyrannosaurus Drip	4	Their mother scolded, “Nonsense!”	62
4055	Tyrannosaurus Drip	7	and she joined them on the tree.	63
4056	Tyrannosaurus Drip	11	Then she looked into the water and exclaimed, “Good gracious me!”	64
4057	Tyrannosaurus Drip	12	The three of them stood trembling, and Dad said, “Get a grip!	65
4058	Tyrannosaurus Drip	9	You’re all of you as drippy as Tyrannosaurus Drip!”	66
4059	Tyrannosaurus Drip	12	He strode onto the bridge and scoffed, “I bet there’s nothing there.”	67
4060	Tyrannosaurus Drip	13	Then he looked into the water - and he jumped into the air.	68
4061	Tyrannosaurus Drip	23	And how the duckbills hooted; when he landed with a crash, And the tree bridge broke ... ... and four Tyrannosauruses went SPLASH!	69
4062	Tyrannosaurus Drip	22	And spluttering, and clinging to the branches of the tree, They went whooshing down a waterfall and all the way to sea.	70
4063	Tyrannosaurus Drip	17	And the duckbills hooted happily they hooted, “Hip hip hip… Hooray for the heroic, one-and-only Duckbill Drip!	71
4064	Elmer in the Snow	16	One morning, Elmer, the patchwork elephant, met a group of elephants who didn’t look very happy.	0
4065	Elmer in the Snow	5	“What’s the matter?” asked Elmer.	1
4066	Elmer in the Snow	12	“What’s the matter is that it’s cold,” said one of the elephants.	2
4067	Elmer in the Snow	4	“That’s what’s the matter.”	3
4068	Elmer in the Snow	6	“It’s not really cold,” said Elmer.	4
4069	Elmer in the Snow	7	“It’s just a bit colder than usual.	5
4070	Elmer in the Snow	11	What you need is a good walk to warm you up.	6
4071	Elmer in the Snow	5	Come on, come with me.”	7
4072	Elmer in the Snow	11	Elmer led the elephants in a direction they didn’t normally go.	8
4073	Elmer in the Snow	14	The way went steeply upwards and the elephants were soon puffing with the effort.	9
4074	Elmer in the Snow	12	“I’m very warm now, thank you Elmer,” said one of the elephants.	10
4075	Elmer in the Snow	5	“Shall we go back now?”	11
4076	Elmer in the Snow	6	“Not yet,” said Elmer “Keep going.”	12
4077	Elmer in the Snow	17	After they had gone further, an elephant said “Elmer, look at the - trees, they’re different here.”	13
4078	Elmer in the Snow	9	“That’s because we are so high up,” said Elmer.	14
4079	Elmer in the Snow	9	“Come on, there’s something I want to show you.”	15
4080	Elmer in the Snow	20	A little later the elephants came out into the open and they stared at the sight - everywhere was white.	16
4081	Elmer in the Snow	1	“SNOW!”	17
4082	Elmer in the Snow	2	they shouted.	18
4083	Elmer in the Snow	16	Although they had heard about snow this was the first time they had actually seen any.	19
4084	Elmer in the Snow	14	The elephants rushed forward and roared with laughter as they played in the snow.	20
4085	Elmer in the Snow	8	“It’s really cold” called one of the elephants.	21
4086	Elmer in the Snow	5	“Cold but fun” laughed another.	22
4087	Elmer in the Snow	8	“Now, come and look at this,” called Elmer.	23
4088	Elmer in the Snow	13	He was sliding on the ice of a pond that had frozen solid.	24
4089	Elmer in the Snow	8	One by one the others curiously joined him.	25
4090	Elmer in the Snow	15	Soon the elephants were slipping and sliding and crashing and falling and really enjoying themselves.	26
4091	Elmer in the Snow	7	They didn’t notice Elmer quietly sneak away.	27
4092	Elmer in the Snow	12	The elephants forgot all about Elmer until they heard his voice nearby.	28
4093	Elmer in the Snow	1	“Help!	29
4094	Elmer in the Snow	1	Help!	30
4095	Elmer in the Snow	3	I’ve frozen solid.”	31
4096	Elmer in the Snow	9	The elephants stopped playing and hurried to find Elmer.	32
4097	Elmer in the Snow	8	To their dismay, there stood a white elephant.	33
4098	Elmer in the Snow	10	“He has, he’s frozen solid,” gasped one of the elephants.	34
4099	Elmer in the Snow	11	Then he touched the white elephant and a piece fell off.	35
4100	Elmer in the Snow	6	“It’s made of snow” he said.	36
4101	Elmer in the Snow	7	“I know where Elmer is” chuckled another.	37
4102	Elmer in the Snow	9	He pointed-to a line of footprints in the snow.	38
4103	Elmer in the Snow	28	“Come on,” The elephants followed the line of footprints but before they reached him, Elmer appeared and witha laugh, started throwing ; snowballs that he had already prepared.	39
4104	Elmer in the Snow	13	It wasn’t long before all the elephants were throwing snowballs at each other.	40
4105	Elmer in the Snow	11	“It’s starting to snow quite hard” said Elmer after a while.	41
4106	Elmer in the Snow	6	“It’s time for us to go.”	42
4107	Elmer in the Snow	23	Still laughing and playing, and with the snow falling all around them, the elephants hurried hack to the trees and then on home.	43
4108	Elmer in the Snow	19	When they were finally home again, one of the elephants said, “Snow is fun, but it really is cold.”	44
4109	Elmer in the Snow	3	“Yes,” said another.	45
4110	Elmer in the Snow	8	“It’s nice to be back in the warm.	46
4111	Elmer in the Snow	3	Elmer said nothing.	47
4112	Elmer in the Snow	3	He just smiled.	48

4129	Sharing A Shell	6	A blob, a bright purple blob.	16
4130	Sharing A Shell	6	What can this blob thing be?	17
4131	Sharing A Shell	14	“Go away, Blob, whoever you are - You can’t share a shell with me.”	18
4132	Sharing A Shell	6	“I’m an anemone, not a blob.	19
4133	Sharing A Shell	6	Please let me share your shell.	20
4134	Sharing A Shell	17	Give me a ride to look for some food And perhaps I can help you as well.”	21

4136	Sharing A Shell	6	A fish, with jaws open wide.	23
4137	Sharing A Shell	7	“Fresh crab for dinner - here goes!”	24
4138	Sharing A Shell	14	Out shoots a tentacle, quick as a flash, Stinging the fish on the nose!	25
4139	Sharing A Shell	22	Two friends, sharing a shell, Under a sky of blue, Romping all over the rock pool In their wonderful home for two.	26
4140	Sharing A Shell	1	Look!	27
4141	Sharing A Shell	12	A brush thing, trying to get in, Wiggling and making a fuss.	28
4142	Sharing A Shell	14	“Go away, Brush, whoever you are - You can’t share a shell with us.”	29
4143	Sharing A Shell	7	“I’m not a brush, I’m a bristleworm.	30
4144	Sharing A Shell	8	Please let me in - don’t be mean.	31
4145	Sharing A Shell	16	I love doing housework; I’ll suck up the scraps And keep the shell lovely and clean.”	32
4146	Sharing A Shell	22	Three friends, sharing a shell, Down by the sparkling sea, Rollicking all round the rock pool In their wonderful home for three.	33
4147	Sharing A Shell	5	But look how they’ve grown!	34
4148	Sharing A Shell	5	The shell is too small.	35
4149	Sharing A Shell	6	“You’re getting too heavy,” says Crab.	36
4150	Sharing A Shell	7	“I’m fed up with being your taxi.	37
4151	Sharing A Shell	8	It’s time that you found a new cab.”	38
4152	Sharing A Shell	3	“Really!” says Blob.	39
4153	Sharing A Shell	2	“How ungrateful!	40
4154	Sharing A Shell	11	Here I am, slaving away, Scaring off all the fierce fishes.	41
4155	Sharing A Shell	8	If that’s how you feel, I won’t stay.”	42
4156	Sharing A Shell	6	“Peace!” cries Brush, but nobody hears.	43
4157	Sharing A Shell	6	The other two creatures split up.	44
4158	Sharing A Shell	6	Blob finds an empty ice-cream tub.	45
4159	Sharing A Shell	6	Crab finds a nice paper cup.	46

4172	Sharing A Shell	14	And out pokes a head From the whelk shell washed up by the foam.	59

4177	Sharing A Shell	12	Rocketing all round the rock pool In their wonderful home for three!	64
4178	The Rhyming Rabbit	12	The Rhyming Rabbit was sitting with his family in a grassy field.	0
4179	The Rhyming Rabbit	24	All the other rabbits were eating the grass, but the Rhyming Rabbit was making up a poem about it: Grass is growing all around.	1
4180	The Rhyming Rabbit	6	It makes a lovely swishing sound.	2
4181	The Rhyming Rabbit	18	It looks so green, it smells so sweet, And — best of all — it’s good to eat.	3
4182	The Rhyming Rabbit	2	"""Stop rhyming!"	4
4183	The Rhyming Rabbit	6	"Start eating!"" said the other rabbits."	5
4184	The Rhyming Rabbit	20	"It was beginning to get dark when one of the rabbits pricked up his ears and stamped a foot, ""fox!"""	6
4185	The Rhyming Rabbit	2	he shouted.	7
4186	The Rhyming Rabbit	9	Straight away, all the rabbits ran to their burrow.	8
4187	The Rhyming Rabbit	31	All except for the Rhyming Rabbit, who closed his eyes and made up a poem about the fox: 0 fearful fox, all rusty red, You fill our rabbit hearts with dread.	9
4188	The Rhyming Rabbit	12	So silently you crouch and sniff Until you catch our rabbit whiff.	10
4189	The Rhyming Rabbit	11	So hungrily, you cunning beast, You stalk your tasty rabbit feast.	11
4190	The Rhyming Rabbit	15	You’re sly and crafty, through and through But we can run as fast as you!	12
4191	The Rhyming Rabbit	8	"""Don't rhyme - RUN!"" yelled the other rabbits."	13
4192	The Rhyming Rabbit	11	The Rhyming Rabbit opened his eyes, saw the fox, and ran.	14
4193	The Rhyming Rabbit	7	He reached the burrow just in time.	15
4194	The Rhyming Rabbit	3	It was night-time.	16
4195	The Rhyming Rabbit	9	The tired rabbits lay down together in their burrow.	17
4196	The Rhyming Rabbit	20	All except for the Rhyming Rabbit who sat apart from the others, singing a song to them: Sleep, rabbits, sleep.	18
4197	The Rhyming Rabbit	11	Snuggle up and close your eyes And listen to my lullabies.	19
4198	The Rhyming Rabbit	3	Sleep, rabbits, sleep.	20
4199	The Rhyming Rabbit	13	Dream, rabbits, dream, Of grassy fields and sunny hours And cabbages and cauliflowers.	21
4200	The Rhyming Rabbit	3	Dream, rabbits, dream.	22
4201	The Rhyming Rabbit	10	“Stop singing – go to sleep!” said the other rabbits.	23
4202	The Rhyming Rabbit	7	The Rhyming Rabbit felt sad and lonely.	24
4203	The Rhyming Rabbit	12	The other rabbits were all snoring but he couldn't get to sleep.	25
4204	The Rhyming Rabbit	6	“The others do nothing but moan.	26
4205	The Rhyming Rabbit	8	I’m going to go off on mv own.”	27
4206	The Rhyming Rabbit	9	he said to himself, and he started to dig.	28
4207	The Rhyming Rabbit	2	“Dig, dig!	29
4208	The Rhyming Rabbit	2	Quick, quick!	30
4209	The Rhyming Rabbit	2	Scrabble, scrabble!	31
4210	The Rhyming Rabbit	2	Kick, kick!”	32
4211	The Rhyming Rabbit	16	The tunnel led him up and down and round a corner, where he met a worm.	33
4212	The Rhyming Rabbit	27	The Rhyming Rabbit stopped in his tracks and made up a new poem: Wonderful worm, deep in the soil, Why do you wiggle and curl and coil?	34
4213	The Rhyming Rabbit	4	Where are you going?	35
4214	The Rhyming Rabbit	4	Where have you been?	36
4215	The Rhyming Rabbit	8	How do you manage to stay so clean?	37
4216	The Rhyming Rabbit	16	How do you change your shape like that, From long and skinny to short and fat?	38
4217	The Rhyming Rabbit	18	And - one more thing that’s been bothering me How can you bear to eat earth for tea?	39
4218	The Rhyming Rabbit	5	But the worm said nothing.	40
4219	The Rhyming Rabbit	10	He had no ears, so he couldn’t hear the poem.	41
4220	The Rhyming Rabbit	10	Round the next corner, the Rhyming Rabbit met a mole.	42
4221	The Rhyming Rabbit	11	The mole's eyes were very small but he did have ears.	43
4222	The Rhyming Rabbit	8	Maybe he would enjoy a spot of poetry.	44
4223	The Rhyming Rabbit	30	The Rhyming Rabbit stood on his hind legs and began to recite: Marvellous mole, as black as coal, With shovelling toes and pointed nose You snuffle around beneath the ground.	45
4224	The Rhyming Rabbit	24	You re practically blind, but never mind; At least you can hear, so lend an ear And hear when I say, “Moles rule okay!”	46
4225	The Rhyming Rabbit	5	"""Be quiet,” said the mole."	47
4226	The Rhyming Rabbit	4	“I’m looking for worms.”	48
4227	The Rhyming Rabbit	11	The Rhyming Rabbit felt very lonely, but he carried on digging.	49
4228	The Rhyming Rabbit	10	He dug and he dug till he met a centipede.	50
4229	The Rhyming Rabbit	21	Straight away, he thought up his best poem yet: 0 centipede with a hundred legs, Supposing you laid a hundred eggs?	51
4230	The Rhyming Rabbit	20	And supposing the baby centipedes had A hundred legs like their mum and dad, How many legs would that be?	52
4231	The Rhyming Rabbit	40	And supposing the baby centipedes grew And they each laid a hundred eggs like you, And all of the new little sisters and brothers Had just the same number of legs as the others, How many legs would THAT be?	53
4232	The Rhyming Rabbit	5	"""Shut up,"" said the centipede."	54
4233	The Rhyming Rabbit	3	“I hate sums.”	55
4234	The Rhyming Rabbit	9	The Rhyming Rabbit felt sadder and lonelier than ever.	56
4235	The Rhyming Rabbit	5	And he felt hungry too.	57
4236	The Rhyming Rabbit	20	He dug his way up out of the earth and into the open air, and found himself on a hill.	58
4237	The Rhyming Rabbit	6	The grass was covered in dew.	59
4238	The Rhyming Rabbit	3	It tasted delicious.	60
4239	The Rhyming Rabbit	11	The Rhyming Rabbit ate and ate till he felt much better.	61
4240	The Rhyming Rabbit	20	Then he gazed up at the night sky and made up a new poem: 0 midnight-blue and velvet sky! 0	62
4241	The Rhyming Rabbit	7	silver stars, so bright and high! 0	63
4242	The Rhyming Rabbit	25	"yellow moon, so clear and full, That shines on trees and grass and… And... and... The Rhyming Rabbit couldn't think of a rhyme for ""full""."	64
4243	The Rhyming Rabbit	6	He stopped and scratched his head.	65
4244	The Rhyming Rabbit	5	“ wool!” said a voice.	66
4245	The Rhyming Rabbit	13	The Rhyming Rabbit turned round and saw a woolly sheep standing beside him.	67
4246	The Rhyming Rabbit	8	“Thank you, Sheep - you found a rhyme!”	68
4247	The Rhyming Rabbit	13	he said, and the sheep replied: “I make up poems all the time”	69
4248	The Rhyming Rabbit	2	Another poet!	70
4249	The Rhyming Rabbit	6	The Rhyming Rabbit stared in wonder.	71
4250	The Rhyming Rabbit	27	Before he could think of a rhyming reply, the sheep went on: “How nice it is to meet a rabbit With whom to share my rhyming habit.”	72
4251	The Rhyming Rabbit	46	The Rhyming Rabbit felt so happy that he decided to make up a poem for the sheep: 0 pretty and poetic sheep Who stands upon the hill so steep, With handsome horns and woolly fleece, As white as snow, or clouds, or... or . . .	73
4252	The Rhyming Rabbit	4	“Geese?” suggested the sheep.	74
4253	The Rhyming Rabbit	15	"She smiled at the rabbit and added, “Shall I make up a poem for you?"""	75
4254	The Rhyming Rabbit	8	“Oh yes, I pray you, sheep, please do!	76
4255	The Rhyming Rabbit	4	replied the Rhyming Rabbit.	77
4256	The Rhyming Rabbit	13	So the sheep cleared her throat and recited: Any old rabbit can dig.	78
4257	The Rhyming Rabbit	20	Any old rabbit can feed, But a rabbit who knows how to make up poems Is a special rabbit indeed.	79
4258	The Rhyming Rabbit	5	Any old rabbit can run.	80
4259	The Rhyming Rabbit	18	Any old rabbit can sleep, But only a very special rabbit Could make up poems with a sheep.	81
4260	The Rhyming Rabbit	5	The Rhyming Rabbit sighed happily.	82
4261	The Rhyming Rabbit	4	The sun came up.	83
4262	The Rhyming Rabbit	5	It was a beautiful day.	84
4263	The Rhyming Rabbit	22	The Rhyming Rabbit and the sheep stayed together all day, making up poems about the sun and the flowers and the trees.	85
4264	The Rhyming Rabbit	30	As evening fell and their shadows grew long, the Rhyming Rabbit remembered his family back in the burrow, and he said to the sheep, “The others must be getting worried.	86
4265	The Rhyming Rabbit	3	Goodbye, dear friend.	87
4266	The Rhyming Rabbit	4	It’s time I hurried.”	88
4267	The Rhyming Rabbit	9	The sheep looked very sad, and said, “You go?	89
4268	The Rhyming Rabbit	2	Oh no!	90
4269	The Rhyming Rabbit	2	Oh woe!	91
4270	The Rhyming Rabbit	2	Oh sorrow!”	92
4271	The Rhyming Rabbit	11	But the Rhyming Rabbit replied, “I will come back again tomorrow!”	93
4272	The Enormous Turnip	8	One morning, the farmer went to his field.	0
4273	The Enormous Turnip	4	He wanted a turnip.	1
4274	The Enormous Turnip	9	He saw one turnip with very big green leaves.	2
4275	The Enormous Turnip	7	“I’ll pick this one,” thought the farmer.	3
4276	The Enormous Turnip	8	The farmer tugged and tugged at the turnip.	4
4277	The Enormous Turnip	4	The turnip didn’t move.	5
4278	The Enormous Turnip	9	The farmer’s wife saw the farmer puffing and panting.	6
4279	The Enormous Turnip	4	“I’ll help,” she called.	7
4280	The Enormous Turnip	4	She hugged the farmer.	8
4281	The Enormous Turnip	5	He grabbed the turnip leaves.	9
4282	The Enormous Turnip	5	They both tugged and tugged.	10
4283	The Enormous Turnip	5	But the turnip didn’t move.	11
4284	The Enormous Turnip	7	Jack saw his parents puffing and panting.	12
4285	The Enormous Turnip	2	“I’ll help!”	13
4286	The Enormous Turnip	2	he called.	14
4287	The Enormous Turnip	5	Jack held his mother’s skirt.	15
4288	The Enormous Turnip	4	She hugged the farmer.	16
4289	The Enormous Turnip	6	The farmer grabbed the turnip leaves.	17
4290	The Enormous Turnip	12	And they tugged and tugged until they were red in the face.	18
4291	The Enormous Turnip	5	But the turnip didn’t move.	19
4292	The Enormous Turnip	5	“Woof.” barked the farmer’s dog.	20
4293	The Enormous Turnip	5	He raced into the field.	21
4294	The Enormous Turnip	6	“Let’s try again,” said the farmer.	22
4295	The Enormous Turnip	5	The dog pulled Jack’s shirt.	23
4296	The Enormous Turnip	5	Jack held his mother’s skirt.	24
4297	The Enormous Turnip	4	She hugged the farmer.	25
4298	The Enormous Turnip	6	The farmer grabbed the turnip leaves.	26
4299	The Enormous Turnip	10	They all tugged and tugged as hard as they could.	27
4300	The Enormous Turnip	5	But the turnip didn’t move.	28
4301	The Enormous Turnip	6	No one saw the cat arrive.	29
4302	The Enormous Turnip	5	She bit the dog’s tail.	30
4303	The Enormous Turnip	5	The dog ripped Jack’s shirt.	31
4304	The Enormous Turnip	5	Jack tore his mother’s skirt.	32
4305	The Enormous Turnip	6	She let go of the farmer.	33
4306	The Enormous Turnip	13	The farmer let go of the turnip leaves... and they all fell over.	34
4307	The Enormous Turnip	8	The farmer brushed the dirt off his clothes.	35
4308	The Enormous Turnip	6	“Let’s try once more,” he said.	36
4309	The Enormous Turnip	6	Just then, a bird flew past.	37
4310	The Enormous Turnip	7	“One, two, three... pull!” said the farmer.	38
4311	The Enormous Turnip	6	The bird pecked the cat’s tail.	39
4312	The Enormous Turnip	6	The cat bit the dog’s tail.	40
4313	The Enormous Turnip	5	The dog pulled Jack’s shirt.	41
4314	The Enormous Turnip	5	Jack held his mother’s skirt.	42
4315	The Enormous Turnip	4	She hugged the farmer.	43
4316	The Enormous Turnip	8	The farmer grabbed the turnip and everybody tugged.	44
4317	The Enormous Turnip	8	They tugged and tugged and tugged some more.	45
4318	The Enormous Turnip	9	Slowly, slowly, Very slowly, the turnip began to move.	46
4319	The Enormous Turnip	5	“It’s big,” said the farmer.	47
4320	The Enormous Turnip	6	huge,” “it’s said his wife- enormous!”	48
4321	The Enormous Turnip	3	“its cried Jack.	49
4322	The Enormous Turnip	9	At last, the turnip popped out of the ground.	50
4323	The Enormous Turnip	4	I f L I	51
4324	The Enormous Turnip	5	The farmer was very happy.	52
4325	The Enormous Turnip	6	“Time for bed,” he said, yawning.	53
4326	The Enormous Turnip	11	That night, he fell asleep with a smile on his face.	54
4327	The Enormous Turnip	11	In the morning, Jack helped his mother chop up the turnip.	55
4328	The Enormous Turnip	6	They ate turnip soup for lunch...	56
4329	The Enormous Turnip	9	turnip soup for supper... and turnip soup for breakfast...	57
4330	The Enormous Turnip	5	every day for a month.	58
4331	The Enormous Turnip	8	“Next year I’m growing carrots,” said the farmer.	59
4332	Why Am I An Insect	11	A dragonfly is an insect Insects are one group of animals.	0
4333	Why Am I An Insect	8	They are a very large group of animals.	1
4334	Why Am I An Insect	7	Ants, moths, termites, and cicadas are insects.	2
4335	Why Am I An Insect	2	But why?	3
4336	Why Am I An Insect	6	What makes an insect an insect?	4
4337	Why Am I An Insect	17	In this book, we will look closely at one insect, FAST FACT the dragonfly, to find out.	5
4338	Why Am I An Insect	27	There are more than a million species, or As you read through this book, you kinds, of insects in will see a next to important the world.	6
4339	Why Am I An Insect	16	There are information that tells you what more insects than any makes an insect an insect.	7
4340	Why Am I An Insect	4	other kind of animal.	8
4341	Why Am I An Insect	8	A dragonfly is an insect with four wings.	9
4342	Why Am I An Insect	10	Different dragonflies There are more than 4000 species of dragonflies.	10
4343	Why Am I An Insect	19	The largest dragonfly species is 10 centimetres (4 inches) long and has a wingspan of 16 centimetres (63 inches).	11
4344	Why Am I An Insect	13	The smallest species has a wingspan of less than 2 centimetres (0.8 inch).	12
4345	Why Am I An Insect	16	A dragonfly does not have a sting, but it may bite if you pick it up.	13
4346	Why Am I An Insect	8	Dragonfly habitat Dragonflies’ habitats are mainly near water.	14
4347	Why Am I An Insect	12	More dragonfly species are found in warm habitats than in cold habitats.	15
4348	Why Am I An Insect	10	Compared to other kinds of insects, dragonflies are quite large.	16
4349	Why Am I An Insect	15	A dragonfly’s body Like all insects, a dragonfly has a body with three main parts.	17
4350	Why Am I An Insect	10	These parts are the head, the thorax, and the abdomen.	18
4351	Why Am I An Insect	14	Head On its head a dragonfly has a mouth, two antennae, and two eyes.	19
4352	Why Am I An Insect	11	Thorax A dragonfly’s thorax is in the middle of its body.	20
4353	Why Am I An Insect	12	The dragonfly’s six legs and four wings are attached to the thorax.	21
4354	Why Am I An Insect	9	All insects have six legs attached to the thorax.	22
4355	Why Am I An Insect	12	Abdomen A dragonfly’s abdomen is at the back end of its body.	23
4356	Why Am I An Insect	8	It is long and thin and bends easily.	24
4357	Why Am I An Insect	12	The abdomens of some insects, such as flies, are short and round.	25
4358	Why Am I An Insect	9	Exoskeleton Like all insects, a dragonfly has no bones.	26
4359	Why Am I An Insect	5	Instead, it has an exoskeleton.	27
4360	Why Am I An Insect	13	The exoskeleton is like a hard skin, and it protects the dragonfly’s body.	28
4361	Why Am I An Insect	5	The exoskeleton is also waterproof.	29
4362	Why Am I An Insect	12	It keeps water in and stops the dragonfly’s body from drying out.	30
4363	Why Am I An Insect	6	Many dragonflies have brightly coloured exoskeletons.	31
4364	Why Am I An Insect	17	FAST FACT Lobsters, crabs, spiders, woodlice, and centipedes are all animals that have exoskeletons instead of bones.	32
4365	Why Am I An Insect	16	But these animals are not insects Inside a dragonfly There are no bones inside a dragonfly.	33
4366	Why Am I An Insect	8	But there are organs that do important jobs.	34
4367	Why Am I An Insect	13	Like all insects, a dragonfly has a heart that is long and thin.	35
4368	Why Am I An Insect	9	It lies along the inside of the dragonfly’s back.	36
4369	Why Am I An Insect	8	The heart pumps blood towards the dragonfly’s head.	37
4370	Why Am I An Insect	9	The blood then flows back through the dragonfly’s body.	38
4371	Why Am I An Insect	9	These are some of the organs inside a dragonfly.	39
4372	Why Am I An Insect	29	heart pumps blood through body brain gets messages from ears, eyes, and antennae, and send s messages to muscles FAST FACT Bees have a honey stomach inside their abdomens.	40
4373	Why Am I An Insect	10	This is used for carrying nectar back to their hive.	41
4374	Why Am I An Insect	24	The nectar is made into honey and fed to the bee larvae Food tube When a dragonfly eats, food passes through its food tube.	42
4375	Why Am I An Insect	9	Nutrients pass from the food into the dragonfly’s blood.	43
4376	Why Am I An Insect	11	Nutrients are the parts of food the dragonfly needs to survive.	44
4377	Why Am I An Insect	16	The dragonfly’s blood carries the nutrients to the dragonfly’s muscles and other parts of its body.	45
4378	Why Am I An Insect	6	Breathing Dragonflies need oxygen to survive.	46
4379	Why Am I An Insect	9	But like all insects, dragonflies do not have lungs.	47
4380	Why Am I An Insect	12	Instead, they get air through holes in the sides of their bodies.	48
4381	Why Am I An Insect	9	A dragonfly gets nutrients from food, such as grasshoppers.	49
4382	Why Am I An Insect	17	Senses Like all insects, dragonflies have senses to help them find food and stay away from predators.	50
4383	Why Am I An Insect	15	Their senses also help them to find each other and to find their way around.	51
4384	Why Am I An Insect	6	Eyes Dragonflies have very large eyes.	52
4385	Why Am I An Insect	5	These give dragonflies excellent sight.	53
4386	Why Am I An Insect	7	Like all insects, dragonflies have compound eyes.	54
4387	Why Am I An Insect	10	Compound eyes are made up of hundreds of separate parts.	55
4388	Why Am I An Insect	15	Each part faces in a slightly different direction, giving a dragonfly an excellent all-round view.	56
4389	Why Am I An Insect	8	A dragonfly’s compound eyes wrap around its head.	57
4390	Why Am I An Insect	11	Antennae A dragonfly has two very short antennae on its head.	58
4391	Why Am I An Insect	4	All insects have antennae.	59
4392	Why Am I An Insect	4	Antennae are sense organs.	60
4393	Why Am I An Insect	7	They pick up smells from the air.	61
4394	Why Am I An Insect	11	Antennae can also sense whether the air is warm or cold.	62
4395	Why Am I An Insect	11	A dragonfly’s short antennae are in front of its compound eyes.	63
4396	Why Am I An Insect	13	FASTFACT Butterflies see colours and patterns that are different from those we see.	64
4397	Why Am I An Insect	18	A flower that looks yellow to us may look blue to a butterfly Flying Dragonflies are excellent fliers.	65
4398	Why Am I An Insect	15	Some dragonflies can fly as fast as 60 kilometres an hour (37 miles an hour).	66
4399	Why Am I An Insect	10	Dragonflies can stop and fly in one spot in mid-air.	67
4400	Why Am I An Insect	5	They can even fly backwards.	68
4401	Why Am I An Insect	14	Before it can fly, a dragonfly must warm up its body in the sun.	69
4402	Why Am I An Insect	9	All insects need the sun to warm their bodies.	70
4403	Why Am I An Insect	11	A dragonfly can stop in mid-air while it looks for food.	71
4404	Why Am I An Insect	1	Wings	72
4405	Why Am I An Insect	9	A dragonfly’s four wings are attached to its thorax.	73
4406	Why Am I An Insect	12	Strong muscles in the thorax make the wings beat up and down.	74
4407	Why Am I An Insect	18	When a dragonfly is flying, the front pair of wings go up as the back pair go down.	75
4408	Why Am I An Insect	13	A dragonfly beats its wings up and down around 30 times a second.	76
4409	Why Am I An Insect	11	Most flying insects rest with their wings lying along their bodies.	77
4410	Why Am I An Insect	13	But when a dragonfly is not flying, its wings lie across its body.	78
4411	Why Am I An Insect	12	A dragonfly’s rear wings are almost as long as its front wings.	79
4412	Why Am I An Insect	16	FAST FACT Some insects, such as the head louse, do not have wings and cannot fly.	80
4413	Why Am I An Insect	14	The head louse moves from hair to hair by holding on with its claws.	81
4414	Why Am I An Insect	4	Food Dragonflies are predators.	82
4415	Why Am I An Insect	8	This means they kill and eat other animals.	83
4416	Why Am I An Insect	9	Most of a dragonfly’s prey are other flying insects.	84
4417	Why Am I An Insect	5	These include flies and midges.	85
4418	Why Am I An Insect	2	Finding prey	86
4419	Why Am I An Insect	10	A dragonfly flies along the water’s edge looking for prey.	87
4420	Why Am I An Insect	13	It may stop in mid-air, waiting for an insect to fly into view.	88
4421	Why Am I An Insect	13	With its large compound eyes, a dragonfly can see its prey very clearly.	89
4422	Why Am I An Insect	13	A dragonfly can twist and turn in flight to catch other flying insects.	90
4423	Why Am I An Insect	2	Catching prey	91
4424	Why Am I An Insect	7	A dragonfly catches its prey in mid-air.	92
4425	Why Am I An Insect	8	It uses its legs to grasp its prey.	93
4426	Why Am I An Insect	9	It then begins to eat it while still flying.	94
4427	Why Am I An Insect	9	Sometimes, a dragonfly may have to land to eat.	95
4428	Why Am I An Insect	12	This happens when it catches a large insect, such as a cicada.	96
4429	Why Am I An Insect	6	A dragonfly’s mouth has strong jaws.	97
4430	Why Am I An Insect	7	These can cut through an insect’s exoskeleton.	98
4431	Why Am I An Insect	8	FASTFACT Different insects have different types of mouths.	99
4432	Why Am I An Insect	11	A butterfly has a mouth like a straw, for drinking nectar.	100
4433	Why Am I An Insect	17	A cicada has a mouth that can stab into a plant to suck out the plant’s juices.	101
4434	Why Am I An Insect	11	Sometimes a dragonfly lands on a tree to eat a fly.	102
4435	Why Am I An Insect	19	Mating and laying eggs Insects are a very large group of animals, and different insects have different life cycles.	103
4436	Why Am I An Insect	10	Male and female dragonflies mate when the weather is warm.	104
4437	Why Am I An Insect	14	The tip of a male’s abdomen holds onto the female, just behind her head.	105
4438	Why Am I An Insect	11	When they separate, the female is ready to lay her eggs.	106
4439	Why Am I An Insect	12	But often, the male keeps holding on while she lays her eggs.	107
4440	Why Am I An Insect	2	Laying eggs	108
4441	Why Am I An Insect	6	The female flies over the water.	109
4442	Why Am I An Insect	20	She stops in mid-air and then pokes the tip of her abdomen below the water’s surface to lay her eggs.	110
4443	Why Am I An Insect	15	There are some species of dragonflies that go right under the water to lay eggs.	111
4444	Why Am I An Insect	13	In many species, the male guards the female while she lays the eggs.	112
4445	Why Am I An Insect	10	A female dragonfly may lay hundreds of eggs each year.	113
4446	Why Am I An Insect	32	A female dragonfly may hold onto a water plant while laying her eggs FAST FACT In an ant colony or a wasp nest, the queen is the only female that lays eggs.	114
4447	Why Am I An Insect	6	But not all insects lay eggs.	115
4448	Why Am I An Insect	10	For example, female aphids give birth to tiny aphid babies.	116
4449	Why Am I An Insect	15	Dragon Larvae In warm, tropical areas, dragonfly eggs hatch about 5 days after being laid.	117
4450	Why Am I An Insect	12	In cooler areas, the eggs may not hatch until the following summer.	118
4451	Why Am I An Insect	16	The animal that comes out of a dragonfly egg is called a dragonfly nymph or larva.	119
4452	Why Am I An Insect	2	FAST FACT	120
4453	Why Am I An Insect	7	Not all insects have a larva stage.	121
4454	Why Am I An Insect	10	When grasshoppers hatch from their eggs, they are tiny grasshoppers.	122
4455	Why Am I An Insect	8	They grow, moulting several times, to become adults.	123
4456	Why Am I An Insect	9	Living in water The dragonfly larva has no wings.	124
4457	Why Am I An Insect	11	It lives at the bottom of the pond, lake, or stream.	125
4458	Why Am I An Insect	11	It has large jaws and feeds on tadpoles and aquatic insects.	126
4459	Why Am I An Insect	11	It usually hunts by waiting for its prey to come close.	127
4460	Why Am I An Insect	3	Then it pounces.	128
4461	Why Am I An Insect	12	Dragonfly larvae do not need to come to the surface for air.	129
4462	Why Am I An Insect	8	They take in oxygen straight from the water.	130
4463	Why Am I An Insect	16	Growing As the dragonfly larva grows, it has to moult its exoskeleton ten or more times.	131
4464	Why Am I An Insect	11	Each time the larva moults, it has a slightly larger exoskeleton.	132
4465	Why Am I An Insect	31	The dragonfly larva may leave its old exoskeleton on an underwater plant coming an GCsft When a dragonfly larva reaches its full size, it is ready to become an adult dragonfly.	133
4466	Why Am I An Insect	17	Dragonfly larvae in the warmest parts of the world may be fully grown after just 60 days.	134
4467	Why Am I An Insect	17	In very cold places, dragonfly larvae may take 6 years before they are ready to become adults.	135
4468	Why Am I An Insect	11	A. dragonfly larva lives under water until it is fully grown.	136
4469	Why Am I An Insect	2	FAST FACT	137
4470	Why Am I An Insect	5	A moth is an insect.	138
4471	Why Am I An Insect	14	When its larva (a caterpillar) is fully grown, it spins itself a silk cocoon.	139
4472	Why Am I An Insect	11	Later, when the cocoon splits open, an adult moth comes out.	140
4473	Why Am I An Insect	13	Coming out of the water The dragonfly larva crawls out of the water.	141
4474	Why Am I An Insect	16	It may climb a tree trunk or a reed stem, or stay near the water’s edge.	142
4475	Why Am I An Insect	14	The larvae of most species of dragonflies come out of the water at night.	143
4476	Why Am I An Insect	13	This is to keep out of sight of day-time predators, such as birds.	144
4477	Why Am I An Insect	5	The larva stops moving now.	145
4478	Why Am I An Insect	5	Its exoskeleton begins to split.	146
4479	Why Am I An Insect	6	Slowly, the adult dragonfly comes out.	147
4480	Why Am I An Insect	17	In spring, if you look closely, you may see empty dragonfly exoskeletons on reeds and tree trunks.	148
4481	Why Am I An Insect	18	It may take more than an hour for the adult dragonfly to climb out of the larva exoskeleton.	149
4482	Why Am I An Insect	13	When the adult dragonfly first comes out, its wings are wrinkled and soft.	150
4483	Why Am I An Insect	12	This is because they have been squashed up inside the larva exoskeleton.	151
4484	Why Am I An Insect	17	The dragonfly pumps blood through veins in its wings and the wings begin to stretch into shape.	152
4485	Why Am I An Insect	9	The sun dries them and soon they become stiff.	153
4486	Why Am I An Insect	7	Then the dragonfly is able to fly.	154
4487	Why Am I An Insect	12	A young dragonfly cannot fly until its wings have stretched and hardened.	155
4488	Why Am I An Insect	16	Growing up The young adult dragonfly flies away from water for a few days or weeks.	156
4489	Why Am I An Insect	13	During this time, it feeds on insects and its full adult colour develops.	157
4490	Why Am I An Insect	13	The dragonfly may then fly to a pond or stream many kilometres away.	158
4491	Why Am I An Insect	7	Some dragonflies stay at their home ponds.	159
4492	Why Am I An Insect	16	When the weather is warm, they will find a mate and the life cycle begins again.	160
4493	Why Am I An Insect	8	Adult dragonflies live for less than a year.	161
4494	Why Am I An Insect	13	FAST FACT Most insects live only for a few days, weeks, or months.	162
4495	Why Am I An Insect	8	A queen termite may live for 20 years.	163
4496	Why Am I An Insect	13	An adult dragonfly stays the same size for the rest of its life.	164
4497	Why Am I An Insect	4	Is it an insect?	165
4498	Why Am I An Insect	59	A dragonfly is an insect because: it has an exoskeleton instead of bones $ it has a body made up of three main parts: a head, thorax, and abdomen it has six legs it has a long, thin heart and no lungs $ it has compound eyes and antennae it needs the sun’s warmth to heat up its body.	166
4499	Why Am I An Insect	5	A dragonfly is an insect.	167
4500	Why Am I An Insect	11	Test yourself: scorpions There are more than 700 species of scorpions.	168
4501	Why Am I An Insect	8	Scorpions have a hard exoskeleton instead of bones.	169
4502	Why Am I An Insect	8	As they grow, scorpions shed their old exoskeleton.	170
4503	Why Am I An Insect	14	If a scorpion loses one of its eight legs, it grows a new one.	171
4504	Why Am I An Insect	12	Scorpions do not have antennae and their eyes are not compound eyes.	172
4505	Why Am I An Insect	12	A scorpion has a long tail with a sting on the end.	173
4506	Why Am I An Insect	16	This sting is used to kill prey and to protect itself against predators, such as meerkats.	174
4507	Why Am I An Insect	3	Are scorpions insects?	175
4508	Why Am I An Insect	2	You decide.	176

4558	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	25	0nce upon a time, there was a deep, dark forest, where monstrous trees groaned, terrible beasties moaned and wiggly WOOS waited to tickle your toes.	0
4559	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	31	In the middle of the forest, surrounded by thorny bushes, there stood a tall, tall tower, with a pointy roof At the bottom of the tower was a BIG wooden door.	1
4560	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	21	Inside the tower a windy, windy staircase didn't stop until it reached a little wooden door, right at the very top.	2
4561	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	8	And what was behind that little wooden door?	3
4562	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	8	Well, nobody knew, because nobody ever went there.	4
4563	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	33	At least… not until the day when… ... a bold, brave knight, Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and his faithful, fearless cat, Envelope, decided that the time had come for a really big adventure.	5
4564	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	25	Sir Charlie picked his best sword, packed some sandwiches, a big bottle of water and a favourite little something for the journey (just in case).	6
4565	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	13	And with a song in his heart he mounted his good grey mare.	7
4566	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	7	Clip clop, clip clop, clippety clippety clop!	8
4567	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	12	Sir Over the hills and far away rode Charlie and his cat.	9
4568	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	13	(Oh, and a wily witch with a watch followed behind on a broom.)	10
4569	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	14	At last they came to a deep, dark forest, where monstrous trees groaned .	11
4570	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	4	and terrible beasties moaned.	12
4571	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	2	Envelope shivered.	13
4572	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	5	The good grey mare quivered.	14
4573	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	10	(While the witch with the watch covered her eyes.) ?	15
4574	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	10	But brave Sir Charlie stood steady in his boots. '	16
4575	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	6	"Sssshhhhhhl"" he whispered into the woods."	17
4576	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	2	“Tis I...	18
4577	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	10	"Sir Charlie Stinky Socks with a song to soothe you."""	19
4578	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	11	And as Sir Charlie sang his lullaby the trees stopped groaning.	20
4579	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	7	But the terrible beasties went on moaning.	21
4580	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	6	“Stop your moaning,” cried the knight.	22
4581	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	8	“Come out and eat me if you dare!”	23
4582	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	8	Out of the darkness crept six slobbering beasties.	24
4583	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	5	That fearless cat, Envelope, scarpered!	25
4584	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	5	The good grey mare fled!	26
4585	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	12	(And even the wily witch with the watch trembled behind a tree.)	27
4586	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	2	But bold.	28
4587	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	5	Sir Charlie did hot turn.	29
4588	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	6	Brave Sir Charlie did not run.	30
4589	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	15	Instead he drew his trusty sword and did what any good knight would do... ...	31
4590	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	7	he smiled and cut up his sandwiches!	32
4591	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	5	The beasties stood and stared.	33
4592	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	21	They were hairy, hideous creatures indeed, but they were MORE scared of Sir Charlie Stinky Socks than he was of them!	34
4593	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	9	Charlie fed the beasties and the beasties stopped moaning.	35
4594	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	16	(And the wily witch with the watch looked on with a grin and checked the time.)	36
4595	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	11	But this was no way to end a really big adventure.	37
4596	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	38	So Sir Charlie Stinky Socks rescued his cat, rallied his good grey mare and set off once again, never minding the wiggly woos who waited in the grass or the six not so terrible beasties who followed him.	38
4597	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	9	The forest grew thicker and the bushes became thorny.	39
4598	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	20	Lucky for Envelope and the good grey mare that Sir Charlie Stinky Socks led the way with his trusty sword.	40
4599	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	7	Whooshity thwack, whooshity twack, choppity choppity chop!	41
4600	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	23	It was thirsty work for a bold, brave knight; how glad he was to have a big bottle of water by his side.	42
4601	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	1	...	43
4602	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	29	And then, at last, they came to a clearing in the trees where the sun threw down its pale yellow light... … onto a tall, tall tower with… ..	44
4603	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	3	a pointy roof.	45
4604	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	10	But it also threw its light onto . . .	46
4605	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	1	...	47
4606	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	4	a long, green dragon!	48
4607	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	18	He was frightful and fearsome and coughing out fire while he stomped in a temper around the tower.	49
4608	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	6	Haha! thought Sir Charlie Stinky Socks.	50
4609	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	8	Just the thing for a really big adventure!	51
4610	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	4	"""Stop your roaring, dragon!"""	52
4611	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	2	he commanded.	53
4612	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	6	But the dragon did not stop.	54
4613	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	6	He went on coughing out fire.	55
4614	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	6	He went on belching out smoke.	56
4615	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	12	And now his eyes were fixed firmly on Sir Charlie Stinky Socks.	57
4616	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	12	Was this the end of the line for the bold, brave knight?	58
4617	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	2	Oh my!	59
4618	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	7	Envelope didn't hang around to find out.	60
4619	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	7	And neither did the good grey mare.	61
4620	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	12	Only a worried, wily witch and a couple of wiggly woos watched.	62
4621	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	7	But bold Sir Charlie did not flinch.	63
4622	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	6	Brave Sir Charlie did not flicker.	64
4623	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	10	He took out his big bottle of water and... ...	65
4624	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	14	kind, clever Sir Charlie Stinky Socks gave that old dragon a long coooool drink.	66
4625	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	21	"""Now you've stopped coughing,"" said the knight to the long, green dragon, ""tell me what's at the top of this tower."""	67
4626	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	4	The dragon looked up.	68
4627	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	6	The dragon looked at Sir Charlie.	69
4628	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	16	"The dragon scratched his scaly head and said, ""My dear old thing, I haven't a clue."	70
4629	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	14	"It's not a dragon's place to ask, you know - just - to do."""	71
4630	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	12	“Then why don’t we find out?” said Sir Charlie with a grin.	72
4631	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	27	The wily witch took one last look at her watch, jumped for joy and flew off on her broom as Charlie pushed open the big wooden door.	73
4632	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	48	Up the windy, windy staircase marched Sir Charlie Stinky Socks, He didn't stop marching until he had taken his faithful cat, Envelope, his good grey mare, six not so terrible beasties a very curious long, green dragon and a couple of wiggly woos right to the very top.	74
4633	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	10	There he opened the little wooden door and peeped in.	75
4634	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	20	A big black cauldron stood in the middle of the room, and stirring it was the wily witch (of course).	76
4635	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	15	By her side sat a little princess, weeping and wailing in a pool of tears.	77
4636	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	13	Sir Charlie looked at the princess Sir Charlie looked at the bubbling pot.	78
4637	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	6	Sir Charlie didn't wait another minute.	79
4638	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	15	He drew his trusty sword, and bounded over to rescue the little princess. . .	80
4639	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	6	"“Stop your weeping!"" cried the knight."	81
4640	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	12	"""Sir Charlie Stinky Socks is here to save you from the pot."""	82
4641	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	5	The witch cackled with laughter.	83
4642	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	10	"""I'm not going to cook the princess'."" squealed the witch."	84
4643	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	14	"""I'm cooking the food for her birthday party It's today, at three, you see."	85
4644	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	7	I do it every year, you know.	86
4645	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	8	I blow up balloons and decorate the tower.	87
4646	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	8	I send out invitations - hundreds of them!	88
4647	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	3	"“And looky here!"""	89
4648	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	10	she cried, tip tapping at the face of her watch.	90
4649	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	3	"""It's nearly three!"	91
4650	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	1	"Yippee!"""	92
4651	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	9	“Then, why are you crying, Princess?” asked Sir Charlie.	93
4652	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	25	“Because,” shrieked the princess, “we live in a tall, tall tower with a pointy roof, surrounded by thorns and and guarded by a fire-breathing dragon.	94
4653	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	32	And it’s in the middle of a deep, dark forests, where wiggly wood wait in the grass to tickle your toes, hungry beasties moan and monstrous trees groan… so nobody ever comes!”	95
4654	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	13	"""Oh, yes they do,"" said Sir Charlie, as he flung open the door."	96
4655	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	7	“Behold Sir Stinky Socks and his friends!”	97
4656	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	25	That night the lights burned brightly in the tall, tall tower with the pointy roof, as a happy little princess had a rip-roaring good time!	98
4657	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	36	When the candles had been blown out and the cake eaten up, Sir Charlie Stinky Socks took out the favourite little something he had brought from home (just in case), and gave it to the princess.	99
4658	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	6	"""Many happy returns of the day!"""	100
4659	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	2	he said.	101
4660	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	19	And everyone cheered hooray, hooray, hooray, because that's what people do at the end of a really big adventure.	102
4661	Sir Charlie Stinky Socks and the Really Big Adventure	2	THE END.	103
4662	The Snail and the Whale	15	This is a tale of a tiny snail And a great big, grey-blue humpback whale.	0
4663	The Snail and the Whale	17	This is a rock as black as soot, And this is a snail with an itchy foot.	1
4664	The Snail and the Whale	19	The sea snail slithered all over the rock And gazed at the sea and the ships in the dock.	2
4665	The Snail and the Whale	8	And as she gazed she sniffed and sighed.	3
4666	The Snail and the Whale	9	“The sea is deep and the world is wide!	4
4667	The Snail and the Whale	5	How I long to sail!”	5
4668	The Snail and the Whale	4	Said the tiny snail.	6
4669	The Snail and the Whale	28	These are the other snails in the flock, Who all stuck tight to the smooth black rock And said to the snail with the itchy foot, “Be quiet!	7
4670	The Snail and the Whale	2	Don’t wriggle!	8
4671	The Snail and the Whale	2	Sit still!	9
4672	The Snail and the Whale	2	Stay put!”	10
4673	The Snail and the Whale	13	But the tiny sea snail sighed and sniffed, Then cried, “I’ve got it!	11
4674	The Snail and the Whale	4	I’ll hitch a lift!”	12
4675	The Snail and the Whale	20	This is the trail Of the tiny snail, A silvery trail that looped and curled And said . . .	13
4676	The Snail and the Whale	5	“Lift wanted around the world.”	14
4677	The Snail and the Whale	18	This is the whale who came one night When the tide was high and the stars were bright.	15
4678	The Snail and the Whale	25	A humpback whale, immensely long, Who sang to the snail a wonderful song Of shimmering ice and coral caves And shooting stars and enormous waves.	16
4679	The Snail and the Whale	9	And this is the tail Of the humpback whale.	17
4680	The Snail and the Whale	17	He held it out of the starlit sea And said to the snail, “Come sail with me.”	18
4681	The Snail and the Whale	30	This is the sea, So wild and free, That carried the whale And the snail on his tail To towering icebergs and far-off lands, With fiery mountains and golden sands.	19
4682	The Snail and the Whale	25	These are the waves that arched and crashed, That foamed and frolicked and sprayed and splashed The tiny snail On the tail of the whale.	20
4683	The Snail and the Whale	29	These are the caves Beneath the waves, Where stripy fish with feathery fins And sharks with hideous toothy grins Swam round the whale And the snail on his tail.	21
4684	The Snail and the Whale	34	This is the sky So vast and high, Sometimes sunny and blue and warm, Sometimes filled with a thunderstorm, With zigzag lightning Flashing and frightening The tiny snail On the tail of the whale.	22
4685	The Snail and the Whale	37	And she gazed at the sky, the sea, the land, The waves and the caves and the golden sand, She gazed and gazed, amazed by it all, And she said to the whale, “I feel so small.”	23
4686	The Snail and the Whale	22	But- then came the day These are the speedboats, running a race, Zigging and The whale lost his way . . .	24
4687	The Snail and the Whale	20	zooming all over the place, Upsetting the whale with their earsplitting roar, Making him swim too close to the shore.	25
4688	The Snail and the Whale	9	This is the tide, slipping away . . .	26
4689	The Snail and the Whale	10	And this is the whale lying beached in a bay.	27
4690	The Snail and the Whale	1	“Quick!	28
4691	The Snail and the Whale	3	Off the sand!	29
4692	The Snail and the Whale	6	Back to sea!” cried the snail.	30
4693	The Snail and the Whale	5	“I can’t move on land!	31
4694	The Snail and the Whale	6	I’m too big!” moaned the whale.	32
4695	The Snail and the Whale	7	The snail felt helpless and terribly small.	33
4696	The Snail and the Whale	4	Then, “I’ve got it!”	34
4697	The Snail and the Whale	6	she cried, and started to crawl.	35
4698	The Snail and the Whale	8	“I must not fail,” Said the tiny snail.	36
4699	The Snail and the Whale	17	This is the bell on the school in the bay, Ringing the children in from their play.	37
4700	The Snail and the Whale	12	This is the teacher, holding her chalk, Telling the class, “Sit straight!	38
4701	The Snail and the Whale	2	Don’t talk!”	39
4702	The Snail and the Whale	10	This is the board, as black as soot. . .	40
4703	The Snail and the Whale	9	And this is the snail with the itchy foot!	41
4704	The Snail and the Whale	2	‘A snail!	42
4705	The Snail and the Whale	2	A snail!’	43
4706	The Snail and the Whale	4	The teacher turns pale.	44
4707	The Snail and the Whale	4	‘Look!’ say the children.	45
4708	The Snail and the Whale	4	‘It’s leaving a trail.’	46
4709	The Snail and the Whale	36	This is the trail of the tiny snail, A silvery trail saying… Save the whale These are the children, running from school, Fetching the firemen, digging a pool, Squirting and spraying to keep the whale cool.	47
4710	The Snail and the Whale	15	This is the tide coming into the bay, And these are the villagers shouting, “Hooray’.”	48
4711	The Snail and the Whale	12	As the whale and the snail travel safely away . . .	49
4712	The Snail and the Whale	15	Back to the dock And the flock on the rock, Who said, “How time’s flown!”	50
4713	The Snail and the Whale	4	And, “Haven’t you grown!”	51
4714	The Snail and the Whale	44	And the whale and the snail Told their wonderful tale Of shimmering ice and coral caves, And shooting stars and enormous waves, And of how the snail, so small and frail, With her looping, curling, silvery trail, Saved the life of the humpback whale.	52
4715	The Snail and the Whale	16	Then the humpback whale Held out his tail And on crawled snail after snail after snail.	53
4716	The Snail and the Whale	19	And they sang to the sea as they all set sail On the tail of the grey-blue humpback whale.	54
4717	Ruby's Worry	4	Ruby loved being Ruby.	0
4718	Ruby's Worry	14	She loved to swing up high… and she loved to explore wild, faraway places.	1
4719	Ruby's Worry	14	Sometimes she even went all the way to the very bottom of the garden!	2
4720	Ruby's Worry	4	Ruby was perfectly happy.	3
4721	Ruby's Worry	3	Until one day...	4
4722	Ruby's Worry	4	she discovered a Worry.	5
4723	Ruby's Worry	6	It wasn’t a very big Worry...	6
4724	Ruby's Worry	13	In fact, it was so small that, at first, Ruby hardly noticed it.	7
4725	Ruby's Worry	7	But then the Worry started to grow.	8
4726	Ruby's Worry	8	Each day it got a little bit bigger...	9
4727	Ruby's Worry	6	It just wouldn’t leave her alone.	10
4728	Ruby's Worry	12	It was there at breakfast, staring at her over the cereal box.	11
4729	Ruby's Worry	12	And it was STILL there at night, when she cleaned her teeth.	12
4730	Ruby's Worry	17	The funny thing was that no one else could see Ruby’s Worry - not even her teacher.	13
4731	Ruby's Worry	9	So Ruby pretended that she couldn’t see it either.	14
4732	Ruby's Worry	15	She tried to carry on as if everything was normal - but it just wasn’t!	15
4733	Ruby's Worry	15	The Worry was always there - stopping her from doing the things that she loved.	16
4734	Ruby's Worry	9	Ruby wondered if the worry would ever go away.	17
4735	Ruby's Worry	4	What if it didn’t?	18
4736	Ruby's Worry	7	What if it stayed with her forever?	19
4737	Ruby's Worry	22	Ruby didn’t realise, but she was doing the worst thing you can ever do with a worry… she was worrying about it!	20
4738	Ruby's Worry	5	Now the worry was enormous!	21
4739	Ruby's Worry	9	It could barely fit in the kitchen at teatime.	22
4740	Ruby's Worry	9	It filled up half of the school bus ...	23
4741	Ruby's Worry	9	And it took up whole rows at the cinema.	24
4742	Ruby's Worry	21	The worry became the only thing that Ruby could think about, and it seemed like she would never feel happy again.	25
4743	Ruby's Worry	7	Then, one day, something unexpected happened ...	26
4744	Ruby's Worry	9	Ruby noticed a boy sitting alone at the park.	27
4745	Ruby's Worry	7	He looked how she felt - sad.	28
4746	Ruby's Worry	11	And then she noticed something else, something hovering next to him.	29
4747	Ruby's Worry	6	Could it be ... a Worry?	30
4748	Ruby's Worry	2	It was!	31
4749	Ruby's Worry	13	Ruby realised that she wasn’t the only person with a Worry after all.	32
4750	Ruby's Worry	5	Other people had them too.	33
4751	Ruby's Worry	18	She asked the boy what was on his mind and, as he told her, the strangest thing happened...	34
4752	Ruby's Worry	5	his Worry began to shrink!	35
4753	Ruby's Worry	19	Then Ruby did the best thing you can ever do if you have a Worry... she talked about it.	36
4754	Ruby's Worry	17	As the words tumbled out, Ruby’s worry began to shrink until it was barely there at all.	37
4755	Ruby's Worry	7	Soon, both of their Worries were gone!	38
4756	Ruby's Worry	6	Finally Ruby felt like herself again!	39
4757	Ruby's Worry	20	Of course, that wasn’t the last time that she ever had a Worry (everyone gets them from time to time).	40
4758	Ruby's Worry	17	But now that she knew how to get rid of them... they never hung around for long.	41
4759	The Smeds and The Smoos	18	By a loobular lake on a far-off planet There lived a young Smed, and her name was Janet.	0
4760	The Smeds and The Smoos	17	Not far away, on a humplety hill, There lived a young Smoo by the name of Bill.	1
4761	The Smeds and The Smoos	20	Janet, like all the Smeds, was red, And this is what her grandfather said: “Never, never play with the Smoos.	2
4762	The Smeds and The Smoos	4	They sleep in holes.	3
4763	The Smeds and The Smoos	4	They wear strange shoes.	4
4764	The Smeds and The Smoos	5	They jump about like kangaroos.	5
4765	The Smeds and The Smoos	27	Never, never play with the Smoos Bill, like the other Smoos, was blue, And these were the words of Grandmother Smoo: “Never, never play with the Smeds.	6
4766	The Smeds and The Smoos	7	They have strange hair upon their heads.	7
4767	The Smeds and The Smoos	7	They sleep in funny things called beds.	8
4768	The Smeds and The Smoos	6	Never, never play with the Smeds.”	9
4769	The Smeds and The Smoos	15	The Smeds on their lake liked nothing better Than splashing about getting wetter and wetter.	10
4770	The Smeds and The Smoos	15	But Janet grew bored with this watery play And early one morning she tiptoed away.	11
4771	The Smeds and The Smoos	8	The Smoos jumped about on their humpiety hill.	12
4772	The Smeds and The Smoos	10	They bounced up and down it and never stood still.	13
4773	The Smeds and The Smoos	17	But Bill was beginning to think ‘This is boring,’ So early one morning he set off exploring.	14
4774	The Smeds and The Smoos	17	Janet met Bill in the Wurpular Wood, Where the trockles grew tall and the glompoms smelled good.	15
4775	The Smeds and The Smoos	9	The two rubbed antennae and played all day long.	16
4776	The Smeds and The Smoos	10	She told him a story; he sang her a song.	17
4777	The Smeds and The Smoos	17	Then they climbed to the top of a jerberrycoot And nibbled its juicy and jellyful fruit... ...	18
4778	The Smeds and The Smoos	21	Till who should, disturb them but Grandfather Smed, Shaking his fist as he angrily said: “Never, never play with a Smoo.	19
4779	The Smeds and The Smoos	9	They re such a nasty shade of hl tie.	20
4780	The Smeds and The Smoos	14	"For the hundredth time I say to you, Never, never play with a Smoo."""	21
4781	The Smeds and The Smoos	19	Grandmother Smoo was close behind And this is how she spoke her mind: “Never, never play with a Smed.	22
4782	The Smeds and The Smoos	7	They’re such a dreadful shade of red.	23
4783	The Smeds and The Smoos	13	"I’ll say again what I’ve always said: Never, never play with a Smed."""	24
4784	The Smeds and The Smoos	7	Years went by on the far-off planet.	25
4785	The Smeds and The Smoos	7	Janet missed Bill, and Bill missed Janet.	26
4786	The Smeds and The Smoos	15	But off they crept, whenever they could, To sing and play in the Wurpular Wood.	27
4787	The Smeds and The Smoos	17	The two of them grew and decided to wed, But what do you think their grandparents said?	28
4788	The Smeds and The Smoos	5	“Never, never marry a Smoo.	29
4789	The Smeds and The Smoos	5	They re a beastly bunch!	30
4790	The Smeds and The Smoos	5	They re a crazy crew!	31
4791	The Smeds and The Smoos	4	They drink black tea!	32
4792	The Smeds and The Smoos	4	They eat green stew!	33
4793	The Smeds and The Smoos	5	Never, never marry a Smoo.	34
4794	The Smeds and The Smoos	5	“Never, never marry a Smed.	35
4795	The Smeds and The Smoos	8	My dearest child, are you off your head?	36
4796	The Smeds and The Smoos	4	They drink pink milk!	37
4797	The Smeds and The Smoos	4	They eat brown bread!	38
4798	The Smeds and The Smoos	5	Never, never marry a Smed.	39
4799	The Smeds and The Smoos	16	Janet and Bill stole out that night While their families slept and the squoon shone bright.	40
4800	The Smeds and The Smoos	7	They clambered into the Smeds’ red rocket.	41
4801	The Smeds and The Smoos	7	(Grandfather Smed had forgotten to lock it.)	42
4802	The Smeds and The Smoos	15	Bill pressed the button, and Janet steered… When their families woke, they had both disappeared!	43
4803	The Smeds and The Smoos	18	The Smeds said, “Your Bill must have stolen our Janet And taken her off to a distant planet.”	44
4804	The Smeds and The Smoos	17	The Smoos said, “It’s Janet who’s stolen our Bill And lured him away from the humplety hill.”	45
4805	The Smeds and The Smoos	19	The Smoos climbed into their rocket of blue, And they said to the Smeds, “You had better come, too.”	46
4806	The Smeds and The Smoos	10	Suspicious and scowling, they soared into space . . .	47
4807	The Smeds and The Smoos	1	...	48
4808	The Smeds and The Smoos	9	Till they reached Planet Vumjum, a dry, dusty place.	49
4809	The Smeds and The Smoos	20	The Vums had long arms which they waved in the air, But they didn’t have news of the runaway pair.	50
4810	The Smeds and The Smoos	18	The next stop was Lurglestrop, covered in roses, And watered by beasts with small eyes and long noses.	51
4811	The Smeds and The Smoos	4	They touched down 6n.	52
4812	The Smeds and The Smoos	4	Grimbletosh, coated in grime.	53
4813	The Smeds and The Smoos	9	They searched Planet Glurch and found nothing but slime.	54
4814	The Smeds and The Smoos	22	One morning the Smoos found they’d run out of tea, So the Smeds shared their milk, which was pink as could be.	55
4815	The Smeds and The Smoos	17	Then Grandfather Smed said, “My hair needs a trim,” And Grandmother Smoo kindly cut it for him.	56
4816	The Smeds and The Smoos	19	They landed on Scloop, where the Scloopies wore kilts, Then flew to Klaboo, where the Klabs walked on stilts.	57
4817	The Smeds and The Smoos	19	They searched all year long, then they searched longer still, But they didn’t find Janet; they didn’t find Bill.	58
4818	The Smeds and The Smoos	9	“Alas,” said the Smoos, and the Smeds said, “Alack!	59
4819	The Smeds and The Smoos	6	We have failed in our quest.	60
4820	The Smeds and The Smoos	5	We had better turn back.”	61
4821	The Smeds and The Smoos	21	So they turned and flew home to their very own planet, And far down below them, they saw . . .	62
4822	The Smeds and The Smoos	2	.. .	63
4823	The Smeds and The Smoos	3	Bill and Janet!	64
4824	The Smeds and The Smoos	20	The rocket touched down, and they ran to the wood Where the trockles grew tall and the glompoms smelled good.	65
4825	The Smeds and The Smoos	18	And there in a glade, by the rocket of red, Were the runaway Smoo and the runaway Smed.	66
4826	The Smeds and The Smoos	19	(They’d got lost and flown home again, only to find That all of the others had left them behind.)	67
4827	The Smeds and The Smoos	6	There was joy, jam and jumping.	68
4828	The Smeds and The Smoos	14	Then Janet said, “Maybe You’d like to make friends with our dear little baby?”	69
4829	The Smeds and The Smoos	2	A baby!	70
4830	The Smeds and The Smoos	3	A red one?	71
4831	The Smeds and The Smoos	3	A blue one?	72
4832	The Smeds and The Smoos	10	But no— That baby was purple, from head to toe!	73
4833	The Smeds and The Smoos	17	They all hugged the Smoo-Smed, their new baby brother, And Grandpa and Gran even hugged one another.	74
4834	The Smeds and The Smoos	20	They laughed and they splashed and they danced with delight, And they played with that baby from morning till night.	75
4835	The Smeds and The Smoos	5	They made him a rattle.	76
4836	The Smeds and The Smoos	5	They made him a flute.	77
4837	The Smeds and The Smoos	8	They fed him the fruit of the jerberrycoot.	78
4838	The Smeds and The Smoos	30	Then they sang by the light of the silvery squoon, And you can sing, too, if you make up a tune: Play with the Smeds and play with the Smoos.	79
4839	The Smeds and The Smoos	6	Play with whichever friends you choose.	80
4840	The Smeds and The Smoos	17	Then, close your eyes and, while you snooze, Dream of the Smeds and dream of the Smoos.”	81
4841	I Am Amelia Earhart	4	I am Amelia Earhart.	0
4842	I Am Amelia Earhart	16	When I was little, people told me that girls should wear dresses and play with dolls.	1
4843	I Am Amelia Earhart	7	"They said we shouldn’t have ""unladylike” adventures."	2
4844	I Am Amelia Earhart	3	I didn’t agree.	3
4845	I Am Amelia Earhart	22	In fact, when I was seven years old, my sister and I decided to build our own roller coaster in our backyard.	4
4846	I Am Amelia Earhart	14	We placed two planks of wood up against the side of our tool shed.	5
4847	I Am Amelia Earhart	6	“Grandma’s not going to like this!”	6
4848	I Am Amelia Earhart	14	The cab was a wooden packing box with roller-skate wheels attached to the bottom.	7
4849	I Am Amelia Earhart	10	We greased the wood with lard so we’d move super-fast.	8
4850	I Am Amelia Earhart	1	“AMELIA,	9
4851	I Am Amelia Earhart	9	ARE YOU SURE THIS IS A GOOD IDEA? ”	10
4852	I Am Amelia Earhart	5	“THIS ISN’T A GOOD IDEA.	11
4853	I Am Amelia Earhart	1	IT’S	12
4854	I Am Amelia Earhart	3	THE BEST IDEA!”	13
4855	I Am Amelia Earhart	7	Of course, I got to ride first.	14
4856	I Am Amelia Earhart	4	This was my moment.	15
4857	I Am Amelia Earhart	3	“HERE WE GO.	16
4858	I Am Amelia Earhart	3	IN THREE... TWO...”	17
4859	I Am Amelia Earhart	8	I still remember the wind in my face.	18
4860	I Am Amelia Earhart	5	My stomach seemed to sink.	19
4861	I Am Amelia Earhart	3	I was flying!	20
4862	I Am Amelia Earhart	5	“AMELIA EARHART, TAKE IT APART	21
4863	I Am Amelia Earhart	3	TH IS INSTANT!”	22
4864	I Am Amelia Earhart	8	The crash was loud and noisy and messy.	23
4865	I Am Amelia Earhart	4	It certainly wasn’t ladylike.	24
4866	I Am Amelia Earhart	4	But it was awesome!	25
4867	I Am Amelia Earhart	3	“That was awesome!”	26
4868	I Am Amelia Earhart	8	It wasn’t the last time I would fly.	27
4869	I Am Amelia Earhart	10	As I got older, I went to many air shows.	28
4870	I Am Amelia Earhart	32	When I was twenty-three years old (but still a kid at heart), my dad took me to meet Frank Hawks, a man who would eventually set many of his own flight records.	29
4871	I Am Amelia Earhart	13	For ten dollars, Hawks agreed to take me on my very first flight.	30
4872	I Am Amelia Earhart	2	“You ready?”	31
4873	I Am Amelia Earhart	2	“I’m ready!”	32
4874	I Am Amelia Earhart	14	For ten minutes, we flew through the sky and out over the Pacific Ocean.	33
4875	I Am Amelia Earhart	21	By the time I was two or three hundred feet off the ground, I knew one thing: I had to fly.	34
4876	I Am Amelia Earhart	19	To save for my flying lessons, I worked as a truck driver (which wasn’t ladylike either) . . .	35
4877	I Am Amelia Earhart	18	a stenographer (which is a fancy-schmancy word for someone who writes down what people say) . . .	36
4878	I Am Amelia Earhart	4	and even a photographer.	37
4879	I Am Amelia Earhart	18	Six months after I learned to fly, I bought a bright yellow, used biplane that I names Canary.	38
4880	I Am Amelia Earhart	9	Canary is a cool name for a plane, right?	39
4881	I Am Amelia Earhart	4	“This is my instructor.	40
4882	I Am Amelia Earhart	5	A woman named Neta Snook.	41
4883	I Am Amelia Earhart	4	That’s her real name!”	42
4884	I Am Amelia Earhart	8	But here's my secret: I wasn't a natural.	43
4885	I Am Amelia Earhart	5	I wasn’t the best pilot.	44
4886	I Am Amelia Earhart	7	I just worked harder than anyone else.	45
4887	I Am Amelia Earhart	5	“That’s enough flying for today.”	46
4888	I Am Amelia Earhart	5	“No” I can do better!	47
4889	I Am Amelia Earhart	3	One more flight!”	48
4890	I Am Amelia Earhart	20	Most important, like that day on the roller coaster, I dared to do what so many said couldn’t be done.	49
4891	I Am Amelia Earhart	6	“A girl flying across the Atlantic?	50
4892	I Am Amelia Earhart	8	Amelia, you sure this is a good idea?”	51
4893	I Am Amelia Earhart	9	“This isn’t a good idea, it’s the best idea!”	52
4894	I Am Amelia Earhart	22	I became the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean—and then the first woman to fly by myself across the Atlantic.	53
4895	I Am Amelia Earhart	12	Back then, people took boats to get to Europe, sailing for weeks.	54
4896	I Am Amelia Earhart	6	Planes were still a new thing.	55
4897	I Am Amelia Earhart	24	In fact, on the day I took off, one magazine ran an article that said women would never be able to fly that far.	56
4898	I Am Amelia Earhart	3	But I did.	57
4899	I Am Amelia Earhart	18	To do it, I had to fly for fourteen hours and fifty-six minutes with no rest, no break.	58
4900	I Am Amelia Earhart	14	Sometimes the sun was so blinding, I could barely see where I was going.	59
4901	I Am Amelia Earhart	25	In the process, I also broke the record for crossing the ocean in the shortest time, doing it faster than any man or woman ever.	60
4902	I Am Amelia Earhart	3	“This is awesome!”	61
4903	I Am Amelia Earhart	14	“IN OCTOBER 1922, I BROKE The WOMEN'S ALTITUDE RECORD BY RISING TO 4,000 FEET!	62
4904	I Am Amelia Earhart	14	AND IN JULY 1930, I SET A SPEED RECORD OF OV ER 181 MPH!	63
4905	I Am Amelia Earhart	21	Then I broke an altitude record, which is just a fancy- schmancy way of saying I went higher than anyone else.	64
4906	I Am Amelia Earhart	5	How high did I go?	65
4907	I Am Amelia Earhart	18	About twelve Empire State Buildings straight up, at a time when no woman had ever gone that high.	66
4908	I Am Amelia Earhart	7	In my life, I took many flights.	67
4909	I Am Amelia Earhart	16	Every single time, there was someone who said that I wouldn’t be able to do it.	68
4910	I Am Amelia Earhart	5	Never let anyone stop you.	69
4911	I Am Amelia Earhart	6	Whatever your dream is, chase it.	70
4912	I Am Amelia Earhart	4	Work hard for it.	71
4913	I Am Amelia Earhart	4	You will find it.	72
4914	I Am Amelia Earhart	9	It is the best lesson I can give you.	73
4915	I Am Amelia Earhart	4	I am Amelia Earhart.	74
4916	I Am Amelia Earhart	4	I know no bounds.	75
4917	I Am Amelia Earhart	20	And I hope you’ll remember that the greatest flight you’ll ever take, is the one no one has tried before.	76
4918	I Am Amelia Earhart	10	"""Never interrupt someone doing what you said couldn't be done."""	77

4921	It's Christmas	7	Christmas was coming and Archie was excited.	0
4922	It's Christmas	4	More excited than EVER.	1
4923	It's Christmas	2	“Jingle Bells!”	2
4924	It's Christmas	5	Dad's Christmas biscuits smelled yummy.	3
4925	It's Christmas	8	But Archie wanted to make them even better.	4
4926	It's Christmas	12	So he plopped on more icing and shook on LOTS of Sprinkles.	5
4927	It's Christmas	4	"“Look, Dad!"" said Archie."	6
4928	It's Christmas	2	“Christmas penguins!”	7
4929	It's Christmas	7	Next Archie helped Mum decorate the tree.	8
4930	It's Christmas	10	But the new decorations weren’t quite right . . .	9
4931	It's Christmas	7	So Archie found the old ones instead.	10
4932	It's Christmas	9	He even found the star that NEVER stopped flashing!	11
4933	It's Christmas	6	Now it really feels like Christmas!	12
4934	It's Christmas	2	Archie smiled.	13
4935	It's Christmas	2	Ding Dong!	14
4936	It's Christmas	3	Went the doorbell.	15
4937	It's Christmas	9	It Granny and Grandpa in their lovely Christmas jumpers!	16
4938	It's Christmas	8	Archie looked down at his jumper and sighed.	17
4939	It's Christmas	13	So out came his craft box and Archie got busy . . .	18
4940	It's Christmas	1	Ta-daa!	19
4941	It's Christmas	8	Archie beamed, and he gave a little twirl.	20
4942	It's Christmas	3	“Mind the tree!”	21
4943	It's Christmas	11	Grandpa cried as it wibbled and wobbled and . . .	22
4944	It's Christmas	1	CRASH!	23
4945	It's Christmas	13	Now then aaid Mum, I wonder… Who would like a VERY Christmassy job?	24
4946	It's Christmas	7	Mum sat Archie down by the window.	25
4947	It's Christmas	8	“I need you to watch . . .	26
4948	It's Christmas	4	"for Snow,"" she whispered."	27
4949	It's Christmas	3	"""Yay!"" cheered Archie."	28
4950	It's Christmas	4	"""Snow is SUPER “Christmassy!"""	29
4951	It's Christmas	6	Archie waited, and Waited, and WAITED.	30
4952	It's Christmas	5	But the Snow didn't come.	31
4953	It's Christmas	3	Not one flake.	32
4954	It's Christmas	5	“This isn’t Christmassy at all!”	33
4955	It's Christmas	4	Even Tiger looked sad.	34
4956	It's Christmas	10	But then Archie had a brilliant idea . . .	35
4957	It's Christmas	2	“Mum! Dad!	36
4958	It's Christmas	1	Look!	37
4959	It's Christmas	2	It’s Snowing!”	38
4960	It's Christmas	6	Q - “Oh, Archie!” sighed Dad.	39
4961	It's Christmas	10	“Look - you’ve buried all the presents in the snow!”	40
4962	It's Christmas	8	So Archie Swept the Snow off the presents.	41
4963	It's Christmas	10	But – oops! - he swept the labels off too!	42
4964	It's Christmas	5	Where did each one GO?	43
4965	It's Christmas	13	By Christmas morning everything felt perfectly Christmassy — there was even REAL snow!	44
4966	It's Christmas	7	"“Time to open Some presents!""' Mum called."	45
4967	It's Christmas	4	They all gathered round.	46
4968	It's Christmas	2	But –	47
4969	It's Christmas	7	oh dear – something wasn’t quite right.	48
4970	It's Christmas	22	Dad had Granny's balls of wool, mum had Grandpa’s fishing rod, Granny had Dad’s drum kit, and Archie had Mum’s favourite perfume!	49
4971	It's Christmas	11	Then Grandpa opened the best present of all . . .	50
4972	It's Christmas	3	“That’s my sledge!!!”	51
4973	It's Christmas	5	Luckily, Mum put everything right.	52
4974	It's Christmas	16	But Granny loved Dad’s drums So much, they let her bang out one more Christmas carol.	53
4975	It's Christmas	7	Now even Archie had to agree ...	54
4976	It's Christmas	7	This was the most Christmassy Christmas EVER!	55
4977	She Rex	7	Ed won't let me share his toys.	0
4978	She Rex	2	He says.	1
4979	She Rex	4	"""Dinos are for boys."""	2
4980	She Rex	5	But I don't need them.	3
4981	She Rex	9	move it, mister... meet T. Rex's bigger sister ...	4
4982	She Rex	10	She Rex is a big and burly, multicoloured dino girly.	5
4983	She Rex	4	I just saw one.	6
4984	She Rex	3	I should know...	7
4985	She Rex	5	"""Well, if you saw one."	8
4986	She Rex	3	"Where’d it go?"""	9
4987	She Rex	5	She went out hunting, probably.	10
4988	She Rex	7	My brother laughs out loud at me.	11
4989	She Rex	8	"""You seriously think you saw a multicoloured dinosaur?"	12
4990	She Rex	6	Big fat NOTHING'S what you've seen.	13
4991	She Rex	3	I know best.	14
4992	She Rex	4	"T. Rex was green."""	15
4993	She Rex	2	You’re right.	16
4994	She Rex	6	Some parts were green, I think	17
4995	She Rex	6	Plus purple, yellow, blue and pink!	18
4996	She Rex	2	"""Pink dinosaurs?"""	19
4997	She Rex	2	Ed snorts.	20
4998	She Rex	2	"""How lame!"	21
4999	She Rex	7	I've had enough of your daft game.	22
5000	She Rex	1	Girlosaurs?	23
5001	She Rex	1	Yuck!	24
5002	She Rex	3	Count me out.	25
5003	She Rex	7	"They'd sing and skip and prance about!"""	26
5004	She Rex	13	"He carries on, ""They'd wear high heels, invite their friends around for meals."	27
5005	She Rex	12	They'd skip through meadows holding hands in flowery dresses like our Gran’s!	28
5006	She Rex	8	I bet you think their scales were frilly.”	29
5007	She Rex	6	"""Ed,"" I say, ""you're being Silly!"	30
5008	She Rex	6	My dinosaurs are mean, for sure.	31
5009	She Rex	9	And boy, oh boy, can these girls ... ROAR!	32

5052	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	10	Once upon a time ...there was a misty blue mountain.	0
5053	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	19	Below the misty blue mountain was a wild, dark forest and by the wild, dark forest was a village.	1
5054	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	25	The village had a stream and a duck pond and an old red apple tree; Beauty and it was home to and her fairytale friends.	2
5055	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	14	Beauty lived with her mum and dad in the grandest house in the village.	3
5056	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	3	Beauty was kind	4
5057	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	9	but sometimes she could be a little bit lazy.	5
5058	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	4	For For her birthday.	6
5059	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	5	Beauty really wanted a pony.	7
5060	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	1	ty’s	8
5061	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	7	But Beauty’s mum and dad weren’t sure.	9
5062	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	15	“Having a pony is a BIG LOT “It will be a responsibility,” warned her parents.	10
5063	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	16	of work - you’ll have to feed it and groom it and keep its stable clean.”	11
5064	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	2	“I PROMISE!”	12
5065	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	10	“I’ll get up early to look after it,” said Beauty.	13
5066	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	5	So Beauty got her pony.	14
5067	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	11	He had a soft, brown coat and a long, flowing mane.	15
5068	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	4	Beauty called him Flick.	16
5069	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	6	At first Beauty kept her promise.	17
5070	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	19	She got up early every morning to fill Flick’s net with hay and put fresh water in his trough.	18
5071	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	7	She groomed his coat until it shone.	19
5072	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	8	She even didn’t mind mucking out his stable!	20
5073	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	19	And every night, before she went to bed, Beauty took Flick his favourite treat - a shiny red apple.	21
5074	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	7	But Beauty’s mum and dad were right.	22
5075	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	5	It was a BIG responsibility.	23
5076	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	9	And Beauty grew tired of looking after her pony.	24
5077	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	18	Sometimes Beauty asked her friends Cinderella, Snow White and Jack to help her - and sometimes they did.	25
5078	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	4	They loved Flick, too.	26
5079	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	8	But they were busy with their own chores.	27
5080	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	11	As the weeks passed, Beauty cared for Flick less and less.	28
5081	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	10	Aren’t you going to groom Flick today?’ asked her mum.	29
5082	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	3	“Soon,” yawned Beauty.	30
5083	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	10	“Have you mucked out Flick’s stable yet?” asked her dad.	31
5084	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	6	“I'll do it tonight,” said Beauty.	32
5085	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	2	Poor Flick.	33
5086	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	16	His stable was a mess and his coat was full of dust and bits of straw.	34
5087	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	6	Flick looked up at Beauty's window.	35
5088	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	10	He was fed up of living in a dirty stable.	36
5089	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	13	He couldn’t remember the last time Beauty had brought him his favourite, treat.	37
5090	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	5	Flick nudged the stable door...	38
5091	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	18	Beauty had been in such a rush to do her chores, she had forgotten to close the latch!	39
5092	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	11	“Wake up, Beauty!” shouted Beauty's mum and dad the next morning.	40
5093	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	3	“Flick has gone!”	41
5094	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	8	Beauty jumped out of bed and rushed outside.	42
5095	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	12	“It's my fault,” “I she sobbed when she saw Flick’s empty stable.	43
5096	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	5	should have taken more care.”	44
5097	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	10	Beauty searched for Flick, but she couldn’t find him anywhere.	45
5098	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	10	She lay awake night after night, worrying about her pony.	46
5099	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	7	Beauty went to see her godmother, Griselda.	47
5100	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	13	“I didn't look after Flick properly,” Beauty told Griselda, “and now he’s gone.”	48
5101	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	6	“Try not to worry,” said Griselda.	49
5102	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	8	“Leave one of these apples out for him.”	50
5103	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	5	And the next morning... ...	51
5104	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	3	Flick was back.	52
5105	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	11	“Flick!” cried Beauty, throwing her arms around the pony s neck.	53
5106	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	15	“I promise I’ll never stay in bed when I should be up, looking after you.”	54
5107	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	29	Flick whinnied and nuzzled Beauty’s face, he was glad to be home... .. especially as from that day on, Beauty always got up early to look after him... ...	55
5108	Wake Up, Sleeping Beauty	7	and she NEVER forgot his favourite treat.	56
5109	No-Bot	9	Bernard the robot loved to play at the park.	0
5110	No-Bot	1	Wheeee!	1
5111	No-Bot	10	He swu ng high, high, high, up into the sky	2
5112	No-Bot	6	Soon it was time to go.	3
5113	No-Bot	9	B ernard jumped off the swing and headed home.	4
5114	No-Bot	12	"He’d only walked a little way, when ""My bottom! cried Ber nard."	5
5115	No-Bot	2	“It’s disappeared!	6
5116	No-Bot	4	"Where can it be?"""	7
5117	No-Bot	16	Bernard went back to the park to look , but he couldn't see his bottom anywhere.	8
5118	No-Bot	6	"“Excuse me, Monkey,"" he said ."	9
5119	No-Bot	5	“Have you seen my bottom?”	10
5120	No-Bot	4	"“Hmmm,"" said M onkey."	11
5121	No-Bot	5	“I think I might have.	12
5122	No-Bot	4	Bird is using it.	13
5123	No-Bot	3	"Come and see!"""	14
5124	No-Bot	11	“Hello, Bird,” said M onkey “Have you still got Bernard’s bottom?”	15
5125	No-Bot	9	"""Ooops, Bernard, was that your botto m?” said Bird."	16
5126	No-Bot	9	“It was too heavy to be a nest... …	17
5127	No-Bot	12	So I gave it to Bear to use in his drum kit.	18
5128	No-Bot	6	"Let’s go and get it back."""	19
5129	No-Bot	13	"""Excuse me, Be au have you been drumming on my bottom?"" asked Bernard."	20
5130	No-Bot	18	“Ooops, Bernard, was that your bottom?” said Bear “It made a funny noise so I couldn't use it.	21
5131	No-Bot	7	I don’t know where it is now.”	22
5132	No-Bot	3	“Oh,” said Bernard.	23
5133	No-Bot	24	"“Don’t worry Your bottom’s got to be somewhere,"" said his friends kindly “Look, there it is!"" said Monkey “That's just Gary's hat,"" said Bernard."	24
5134	No-Bot	13	“There!” said Bird “That’s just Edward’s shopping basket,” said Bernard Isn’t that it?	25
5135	No-Bot	2	said Bear.	26
5136	No-Bot	6	“No, that’s just Dog’s window box.”	27
5137	No-Bot	3	Bernard was sad.	28
5138	No-Bot	8	"“I’ll never get my bottom back,"" he sobbed."	29
5139	No-Bot	15	“Come and sit down ,” said his friends, “and we’ll think where to look next.’	30
5140	No-Bot	6	"“I CAN’T sit down!"" said Bernard."	31
5141	No-Bot	5	“I haven’t got a bottom!	32
5142	No-Bot	7	I’m not a robot- I’m a no-bot!”	33
5143	No-Bot	8	And he walked away, to carry on looking.	34
5144	No-Bot	8	After a while, he arrived at the beach.	35
5145	No-Bot	16	"He looked out to sea, and saw something very familiar There it was ... ""Come back!”"	36
5146	No-Bot	2	he shouted.	37
5147	No-Bot	3	“Come back here!	38
5148	No-Bot	4	You’ve got my bottom!”	39
5149	No-Bot	6	But the rabbits couldn't hear him.	40
5150	No-Bot	9	Bernard jumped and waved but it was no good.	41
5151	No-Bot	10	Then, as he turned away, he spotted a strange-shaped sandcastle.	42
5152	No-Bot	5	He had found his BOTTOM!	43
5153	No-Bot	23	Bernard was so happy to have his bottom back, he d id a wiggling, jiggling dance - and so did all his friends!	44
5154	No-Bot	7	And Bernard never lost his bottom again.	45
5155	The Bumblebear	10	Once there was a bear called Norman, who loved honey.	0
5156	The Bumblebear	6	He really, really, really loved it.	1
5157	The Bumblebear	9	And he was always sad when it ran out.	2
5158	The Bumblebear	11	But getting hold of more honey was always a bit... ...	3
5159	The Bumblebear	1	tricky.	4
5160	The Bumblebear	18	“If only I could be a bee,” he sighed, “I could have as much honey as I liked.”	5
5161	The Bumblebear	10	And then Norman had a quite amazing and brilliant idea.	6
5162	The Bumblebear	8	It was an ordinary morning at Bee School.	7
5163	The Bumblebear	9	“Hello, bees!” said the Queen, who was in charge.	8
5164	The Bumblebear	9	“We have a NEW bee at Bee School today.”	9
5165	The Bumblebear	5	“Oooooh!” said the little bees.	10
5166	The Bumblebear	9	“Everyone, say hello to ... …Norman” “Hullo!” said Norman.	11
5167	The Bumblebear	5	“Ooooh!” said the little bees.	12
5168	The Bumblebear	14	“Aren’t you a bit... big?” asked Amelia, who was a rather clever little bee.	13
5169	The Bumblebear	7	“Um, I’m a SPECIAL bee,” said Norman.	14
5170	The Bumblebear	10	“I come from a land far, far away called ...	15
5171	The Bumblebear	3	GIANT BEE LAND.”	16
5172	The Bumblebear	3	“Hmmm...” said Amelia.	17
5173	The Bumblebear	9	But then it was time for lessons to start.	18
5174	The Bumblebear	27	Daily BEE SCHOOL Planner Name: Norman They began the day with some painting Then Norman joined in with buzzing practice before everyone settled down for a nap.	19
5175	The Bumblebear	17	The bees showed him all sorts of games during playtime, and Norman was brilliant at waggly dancing!	20
5176	The Bumblebear	8	And then it was time to go home.	21
5177	The Bumblebear	6	“Bee School is amazing!” thought Norman.	22
5178	The Bumblebear	9	He couldn’t wait to come back the next day.	23
5179	The Bumblebear	6	The next morning was even better!	24
5180	The Bumblebear	8	Norman was very good at finding smelly flowers.	25
5181	The Bumblebear	5	The bees really liked him.	26
5182	The Bumblebear	16	He was so funny and friendly and he always tried his best… even during flying lessons.	27
5183	The Bumblebear	22	After lunch, the bees learned how to chase away anyone who came after their honey, like spiders, mice, toads ... or bears.	28
5184	The Bumblebear	11	Amelia still felt there was something a bit odd about Norman.	29
5185	The Bumblebear	9	She tried to work out what it was ...	30
5186	The Bumblebear	15	Amelia told the other bees what she had found out, but they didn’t believe her.	31
5187	The Bumblebear	5	“Of course Norman’s a bee!”	32
5188	The Bumblebear	2	they said.	33
5189	The Bumblebear	4	“Just look at him!”	34
5190	The Bumblebear	12	“He is NOT a bee and I shall prove it,” said Amelia.	35
5191	The Bumblebear	9	She took Norman to the bees’ SECRET HONEY STORE	36
5192	The Bumblebear	12	Well, when he saw all that honey, Norman just couldn’t help himself.	37
5193	The Bumblebear	1	HONEY?	38
5194	The Bumblebear	1	HONEY?	39
5195	The Bumblebear	1	Honey?	40
5196	The Bumblebear	8	After all, he really, really, really loved honey.	41
5197	The Bumblebear	11	“See, Norman isn’t a bee - he’s a BEAR!” said Amelia.	42
5198	The Bumblebear	8	“What the jiggins?” gasped all the little bees.	43
5199	The Bumblebear	3	“Mmph?” said Norman.	44
5200	The Bumblebear	9	He was asked to leave Bee school at once.	45
5201	The Bumblebear	10	With Norman gone, things were very quiet at Bee School.	46
5202	The Bumblebear	9	“Norman was such a funny bee,” sighed the bees.	47
5203	The Bumblebear	8	“Norman was such a busy bee,” sighed Amelia.	48
5204	The Bumblebear	16	“Norman was a naughty bear,” said the Queen, “and Bee School is no place for bears!”	49
5205	The Bumblebear	10	But later that night, the bees heard a loud crash!	50
5206	The Bumblebear	4	And a diabolical Roar!	51
5207	The Bumblebear	7	“Oh no!” they cried, “It’s a bear!”	52
5208	The Bumblebear	13	And this bear was BIG and NASTY, and trampled all over Bee School.	53
5209	The Bumblebear	9	It grabbed the hive and started to SHAKE IT!	54
5210	The Bumblebear	7	The bees tumbled out in a panic!	55
5211	The Bumblebear	16	They tried to chase the bear away but it was just too big and too bad.	56
5212	The Bumblebear	11	BUT THEN... … a fearsome buzzing beast burst through the trees.	57
5213	The Bumblebear	4	“Eeek!” squealed the bear.	58
5214	The Bumblebear	4	“It’s a giant bee!”	59
5215	The Bumblebear	9	And it ran away as fast as it could.	60
5216	The Bumblebear	9	The bees were saved and Norman was a HERO!	61
5217	The Bumblebear	17	They gave him a big pot of honey, and the Queen presented him with a special award.	62
5218	The Bumblebear	8	“You definitely aren’t a bee,” said the Queen.	63
5219	The Bumblebear	6	But you are no ordinary bear.	64
5220	The Bumblebear	7	You are, I think - a BUMBLEBEAR.”	65
5221	The Bumblebear	11	And bumblebears were definitely allowed to go back to Bee School!	66
5222	Mole Hill	12	One bright day the Moles awoke to the smell of diesel smoke.	0
5223	Mole Hill	3	“Oh, Daddy! Help!”	1
5224	Mole Hill	8	Mole’s children cried, frightened of what lurked outside.	2
5225	Mole Hill	19	So Mole crept out and then he saw the last thing he was hoping for: “Oh, no!’ said Mole.	3
5226	Mole Hill	2	‘Oh, dear!	4
5227	Mole Hill	2	Oh, shucks!”	5
5228	Mole Hill	8	For on Mole Hill stood three huge trucks!	6
5229	Mole Hill	12	First was Dozer, big and yellow, a grim and fearsome metal fellow.	7
5230	Mole Hill	10	The truck beside was even greater, the rumbling orange Excavator!	8
5231	Mole Hill	12	Last was Loader, strong and tough, not quite as big—but big enough!	9
5232	Mole Hill	6	The diggers moved towards Mole’s mound.	10
5233	Mole Hill	6	They made a dreadful, scraping sound!	11
5234	Mole Hill	3	“STOP RIGHT THERE!’	12
5235	Mole Hill	2	yelled Mole.	13
5236	Mole Hill	2	‘THIS MINUTE!	14
5237	Mole Hill	3	That’s my home.	15
5238	Mole Hill	5	My kids are in it!”	16
5239	Mole Hill	13	The three enormous trucks stopped still and stared at Mole upon his hill.	17
5240	Mole Hill	8	“A mole can’t tell us what to do.	18
5241	Mole Hill	8	We’re a million times as big as you!	19
5242	Mole Hill	3	Now move aside!	20
5243	Mole Hill	4	You’re in our way.	21
5244	Mole Hill	7	We want to build a mall today!”	22
5245	Mole Hill	28	Mole stood his ground and rubbed his head, then thinking fast, he bravely said, “I may be smaller than a digger, but I’ve faced creatures much, much bigger.”	23
5246	Mole Hill	7	The trucks all laughed, ‘Bigger than us?’	24
5247	Mole Hill	1	“Absurd!”	25
5248	Mole Hill	1	“Bizarre!”	26
5249	Mole Hill	1	“Ridiculous!”	27
5250	Mole Hill	14	Mole smiled, “Dig here and soon you’ll see the bones of my last enemy.”	28
5251	Mole Hill	13	So Excavator scooped some ground and took a look at what she’d found.	29
5252	Mole Hill	13	The skull of a terrific beast, a hundred feet from west to east!	30
5253	Mole Hill	6	The creature’s neck was very long.	31
5254	Mole Hill	7	Its tree-trunk legs were thick and strong.	32
5255	Mole Hill	26	Then Dozer pushed some dirt away and found beneath, to his dismay, a massive skull, a bony plate, and two great horns, both long and straight.	33
5256	Mole Hill	13	A third sharp spike upon the snout, a fearsome body, broad and stout!	34
5257	Mole Hill	11	Loader dug in deep and slow, down into the earth below.	35
5258	Mole Hill	14	He found two pairs of dreadful claws and then, much worse, the creature’s jaws!	36
5259	Mole Hill	13	So many teeth, all sharp as pins, not just for smiling monstrous grins.	37
5260	Mole Hill	6	“These bones,” they said, “are terrifying!	38
5261	Mole Hill	8	We thought, brave Mole, that you were lying.	39
5262	Mole Hill	7	These creatures must have reached the sky!	40
5263	Mole Hill	8	Now tell us, please, how did they die?”	41
5264	Mole Hill	13	“These creatures,” said the clever Mole, “once tried to build upon my hole.	42
5265	Mole Hill	14	And when they wouldn’t leave my mound, they ended up here in the ground!”	43
5266	Mole Hill	4	The trucks all trembled.	44
5267	Mole Hill	3	No one blinked.	45
5268	Mole Hill	7	“And now,” said Mole, “they’re all... EXTINCT!”	46
5269	Mole Hill	2	“Oh dear!	47
5270	Mole Hill	4	Oh no!” said Excavator.	48
5271	Mole Hill	4	“We’re out of here!	49
5272	Mole Hill	4	We’ll see you later.”	50
5273	Mole Hill	7	And off they thundered down the hill.	51
5274	Mole Hill	2	Who knows?	52
5275	Mole Hill	5	They might be running still!	53
5276	Mole Hill	13	At last Mole Hill was safe and sound, so too Mole’s children underground.	54
5277	Mole Hill	20	That night at home, the young moles said, as Daddy tucked them into bed, “How did the dinos really die?	55
5278	Mole Hill	8	We think you may have told a lie.	56
5279	Mole Hill	11	Our book here says they were destroyed by an enormous asteroid!”	57
5280	Mole Hill	16	“That’s true,” said Mole, “your book is right, a rock from space hit Earth one night.	58
5281	Mole Hill	8	The dust and smoke blocked out the sun.	59
5282	Mole Hill	7	And the days of dinosaurs were done.	60
5283	Mole Hill	8	But I had to scare those trucks away	61
5284	Mole Hill	6	So we could live another day.”	62
5285	Mole Hill	26	Mole leant in low and kissed each kid and whispered softly as he did, “No new mall, no excavator, no rock from space or impact crater.	63
5286	Mole Hill	10	Not one thing, I guarantee, will ever separate us three.”	64

5546	Dragon Post	3	Lots of meat!	38

5615	Dragon Post	7	Then one day I got some post.	107
5616	Dragon Post	5	And it was… Dragon Post!	108
5617	A Letter to Santa	19	On Christmas Eve, when the snow was all white, I sat on the floor with a letter to write.	0
5618	A Letter to Santa	17	Before I began, I thought what to say I'd like Santa to leave me on Christmas day.	1
5619	A Letter to Santa	5	bear Santa, (I neatly wrote)	2
5620	A Letter to Santa	10	I hope you are well when you read this note.	3
5621	A Letter to Santa	18	I’m sure you have noticed that I have been good, just as my mummy told me I should.	4
5622	A Letter to Santa	17	So if it’s alright, for Christmas I’d like - or a train set or maybe a bike.	5
5623	A Letter to Santa	14	Then when I’d finished, I printed mg name, and added kisses again and again.	6
5624	A Letter to Santa	15	Across to the fireplace I boldly went, and up the chimney my letter was sent.	7
5625	A Letter to Santa	17	For that is the place, I’m sure you will know, that letters to Santa should always go.	8
5626	A Letter to Santa	17	Just how they get there, I don’t understand, but that is the way to Santa’s cold land.	9
5627	A Letter to Santa	38	That winter’s night when the world was asleep, I snuggled in bed - not a sound, not a peep - thinking of Santa and the toys he would bring, and the fun I would have on Christmas morning.	10
5628	A Letter to Santa	9	When, all of a sudden, where could I be?	11
5629	A Letter to Santa	8	Out in the snow in a strange country!	12
5630	A Letter to Santa	19	Next to a cabin in the deep crispy snow, I shiver with cold as I peer in the window.	13
5631	A Letter to Santa	3	It’s Santa’s workshop!	14
5632	A Letter to Santa	4	I must creep inside.	15
5633	A Letter to Santa	10	No one will see me if I’m careful to hide.	16
5634	A Letter to Santa	1	Sssh!	17
5635	A Letter to Santa	16	I must be quiet as I tiptoe in, to see where our Christmas toys all begin.	18
5636	A Letter to Santa	7	I can see Santa reading letters galore.	19
5637	A Letter to Santa	10	Hey, he’s got mine, by his feet, on the floor!	20
5638	A Letter to Santa	36	A map of the world is pinned to the wall, showing Santa the way to the homes of us all, with rooftop instructions so there is no doubt, that any small child is ever left out.	21
5639	A Letter to Santa	33	Just see how busy all Santa’s elves are: One’s making a doll’s house, one a toy car; another elf’s painting a wonderful train, and this elf is putting the wings on a plane.	22
5640	A Letter to Santa	18	Look at that little elf riding a bike, It’s just like the one I said I would like.	23
5641	A Letter to Santa	9	This must be the room where presents ore packed.	24
5642	A Letter to Santa	7	They’re measured for size, then carefully wrapped.	25
5643	A Letter to Santa	17	Tied up with ribbons and finished with bows, each with a name tag so Santa Claus knows.	26
5644	A Letter to Santa	7	Wherever you look there’s bustle and scurry.	27
5645	A Letter to Santa	6	Everyone seems in a terrible hurry.	28
5646	A Letter to Santa	9	Here are the elves who help Santa get dressed.	29
5647	A Letter to Santa	8	There’s Santa’s coat and hat, all neatly pressed.	30
5648	A Letter to Santa	8	And there are his boots getting a shine.	31
5649	A Letter to Santa	9	They look so smart, I wish they were mine.	32
5650	A Letter to Santa	19	I think this room is as good as the rest, for it’s the place that makes Santa look best.	33
5651	A Letter to Santa	8	Back in the workshop, the parcel track halts.	34
5652	A Letter to Santa	10	It seems there’s a problem with one of its bolts.	35
5653	A Letter to Santa	10	The elves are worried – there’s trouble in the air.	36
5654	A Letter to Santa	8	But here comes Santa to make the repair.	37
5655	A Letter to Santa	18	In no time at all, parcels speed on their way, out to the stables and onto the sleigh.	38
5656	A Letter to Santa	6	Outside the stable, the reindeer wait.	39
5657	A Letter to Santa	10	I count them all up and, yes, there are eight!	40
5658	A Letter to Santa	17	Their hooves are polished, their bells burnished bright, as elves brush and groom them in the moonlight.	41
5659	A Letter to Santa	7	Their harnesses gleam, their coats all shine.	42
5660	A Letter to Santa	9	Now the reindeer are restless, as it’s almost time!	43
5661	A Letter to Santa	9	The sleigh is now packed and the reindeer ready.	44
5662	A Letter to Santa	9	Santa at the reins cries, “Away now, go steady!”	45
5663	A Letter to Santa	12	High over clouds and hills they fly, galloping onwards across the sky.	46
5664	A Letter to Santa	13	Soon, beneath them, rooftops they see where inside asleep are children like me!	47
5665	A Letter to Santa	14	When I wake up, it’s Christmas Dag, and just like mg dream, Santa’s been!	48
5666	A Letter to Santa	1	Hooray!	49
5667	A Letter to Santa	19	My stocking is filled up with candy cane, And I’m sure in that parcel there must be a train.	50
5668	A Letter to Santa	1	Great!	51
5669	A Letter to Santa	7	There’s a bicycle propped by mg bed.	52
5670	A Letter to Santa	8	My letter to Santa must have been read!	53

5711	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	15	A small scruffy bear was out walking one evening when he came to a wood.	0
5712	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	32	“What a dark and gloomy place,” he said to himself, and had just decided that he would w alk around the wood, instead of going through it, when he heard a noise.	1
5713	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	11	A squeaking noise — like the sound of frightened little animals.	2
5714	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	7	It was coming from the gloomy wood.	3
5715	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	35	Scruffy Bear set off at once to find out what the matter was, and right in the middle of the wood, caught by the last gleam of the setting sun, he found six white mice.	4
5716	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	4	“Help!” squeaked the mice.	5
5717	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	2	“We’re lost!	6
5718	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	20	And now the night is coming we’ll be gobbled up by owls — or foxes — or snakes for certain!”	7
5719	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	21	And just at that moment they all heard the hoot of an owl coming from the treetops above . . .	8
5720	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	4	“Quick!” whispered Scruffy Bear.	9
5721	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	9	“Curl up tight mice, and tuck in your tails!”	10
5722	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	15	And so the mice curled up tight and carefully tucked away their little pink tails.	11
5723	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	21	A moment later, silent as a ghost, the owl flew down and found Scruffy Bear standing beside six fluffy white balls.	12
5724	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	5	“Hello, Bear!” said the owl.	13
5725	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	7	“You haven’t seen any mice have you?	14
5726	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	17	I’m sure I heard mice, just a moment ago - and it’s about time for my supper!”	15
5727	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	1	“Mice?	16
5728	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	9	Oh no, Owl,” said Scruffy Bear, shaking his head.	17
5729	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	15	The owl looked down at the six white balls and asked, “But what are those?”	18
5730	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	1	“Those?	19
5731	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	7	Why, those are snowballs,” replied Scruffy Bear.	20
5732	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	1	“Snowballs?”	21
5733	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	2	“Yes, snowballs.	22
5734	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	8	I’m collecting them to save for the winter.	23
5735	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	8	It’s good to be prepared, don’t you think?”	24
5736	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	5	“Ah,” replied the owl, nodding.	25
5737	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	4	“Very wise, very wise.”	26
5738	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	8	And he flew off in search of supper.	27
5739	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	13	“Hurry along, mice, hurry along!” said Scruffy Bear when the owl had gone.	28
5740	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	27	And the mice all jumped up and ran along beside him… But they had not gone far before they heard the bark of a fox up ahead.	29
5741	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	5	“Help!” squealed the frightened mice.	30
5742	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	2	“A fox!”	31
5743	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	9	“Quick, curl up again, curl up!” whispered Scruffy Bear.	32
5744	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	8	“And do remember to tuck in your tails!”	33
5745	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	2	They did.	34
5746	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	18	So when the fox stepped out from the shadows, he found Scruffy Bear standing beside six fluffy balls.	35
5747	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	5	“Hello, Bear,” said the fox.	36
5748	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	7	“You’ve not seen any mice, have you?	37
5749	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	10	There are mice about here somewhere — I smell them!”	38
5750	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	6	He began to lick his lips.	39
5751	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	1	“Mice?	40
5752	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	5	Oh no,” replied Scruffy Bear.	41
5753	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	2	“Only eggs.”	42
5754	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	1	“Eggs?	43
5755	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	3	But they’re furry!”	44
5756	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	4	“They’re furry pheasant eggs.	45
5757	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	13	I’m gathering them for the furry pheasant - she lost them, silly bird!”	46
5758	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	12	“Ah ...” said the fox, looking down at the curious furry eggs.	47
5759	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	6	“But I’m sure I smelled mice.”	48
5760	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	8	And he stalked off in search of supper.	49
5761	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	22	“Hurry along, mice, hurry along!” said Scruffy Bear when the fox had gone, and all the mice jumped up and hurried along.	50
5762	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	22	But they had not gone far before they heard the hiss of a slithery snake coming from a thicket just up ahead.	51
5763	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	6	“A snake!” squealed the frightened mice.	52
5764	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	1	“Quick!	53
5765	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	4	Curl up, curl up!”	54
5766	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	3	whispered Scruffy Bear.	55
5767	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	4	“And remember those tails!”	56
5768	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	18	The mice curled up once more, and a moment later the snake came slithering out of the thicket.	57
5769	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	4	“Hello, Bear,” she hissed.	58
5770	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	4	“I’m looking for mice.	59
5771	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	6	Are there any mice around here?”	60
5772	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	10	The snake was staring at the furry white balls ...	61
5773	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	1	“Mice?	62
5774	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	5	Oh no,” replied Scruffy Bear.	63
5775	Scruffy Bear and the Six White Mice	2	“Only apples.”	64

6164	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	9	Once there was a lighthouse keeper called Mr. Grinling.	0
6165	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	15	At night time he lived in a small white cottage perched high on the cliffs.	1
6166	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	19	In the day time he rowed out to his lighthouse on the rocks to clean and polish the light.	2
6167	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	8	Mr Grinling was a most industrious lighthouse keeper.	3
6168	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	4	Come rain... .. .or	4
6169	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	5	shine, he tended his light.	5
6170	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	30	Sometimes at night, as Mr Grinling lay sleeping in his warm bed, the ships would toot to tell him that his light was shining brightly and clearly out to sea.	6
6171	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	28	Each morning while Mr. Grinling polished the light Mrs Grinling worked in the kitchen of the little white cottage on the cliffs concocting a delicious lunch for him.	7
6172	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	32	Once she had prepared the lunch she packed it into a special basket and clipped it onto a wire that ran from the little white cottage to the lighthouse on the rocks.	8
6173	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	6	But one Monday something terrible happened.	9
6174	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	8	Mrs Grinling had prepared a particularly appetising lunch.	10
6175	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	3	She had made...	11
6176	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	22	A Mixed Seafood Salad, A Lighthouse Sandwich, Cold Chicken Garni, Sausages and Crisps, Peach Surprise, Iced Sea Biscuits, Drinks and Assorted Fruit.	12
6177	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	15	She put the lunch in the basket as usual and sent it down the wire.	13
6178	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	6	But the lunch did not arrive.	14
6179	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	17	It was spotted by three scavenging seagulls who set upon it and devoured it with great gusto.	15
6180	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	15	“Clear off, you varmints,” shouted Mr Grinling, but the seagulls took not the slightest notice.	16
6181	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	7	“This is an excellent peach surprise boys.”	17
6182	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	5	“She’s a great cook, Fred.”	18
6183	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	3	“Scrumptious lunch Tom.”	19
6184	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	14	That evening Mr and Mrs Grinling decided on a plan to baffle the seagulls.	20
6185	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	12	“Tomorrow I shall tie the napkin to the basket,” said Mrs Grinling.	21
6186	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	10	“Of course, my dear,” agreed Mr Grinling, “a sound plan.”	22
6187	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	11	“They’ll have to try harder than that to stop us Bert!”	23
6188	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	13	On Tuesday evening Mr and Mrs Grinling racked their brains for another plan.	24
6189	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	10	“They are a brazen lot, those seagulls,” said Mrs Grinling.	25
6190	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	9	“Brazen indeed,” said Mr Grinling, “what shall we do?”	26
6191	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	11	“Our cat does not appear to like seagulls,” said Mrs Grinling.	27
6192	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	12	“No, my dear,” said Mr Grinling, “Hamish is an accomplished seagull chaser.”	28
6193	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	11	“Of course,” exclaimed Mrs Grinling, “tomorrow Hamish can guard the lunch.”	29
6194	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	7	“A most ingenious plan,” agreed Mr. Grinling.	30
6195	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	11	Hamish did not think that this plan was ingenious at all.	31
6196	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	12	He spat and hissed as Mrs Grinling secured him in the basket.	32
6197	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	21	“There, there, Hamish,” said Mrs Grinling consolingly, “I’ll have a tasty piece of herring waiting for you when you arrive home.”	33
6198	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	7	Sadly, flying did not agree with Hamish.	34
6199	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	40	His fur stood on end when the basket swayed, his whiskers drooped when he peered down at the wet, blue sea and he felt much too sick even to notice the seagulls, let alone scare them away from the lunch.	35
6200	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	8	“Pretty kitty, like a piece of lobster mornay?”	36
6201	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	7	“This food gets better every day Fred.”	37
6202	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	7	“Aren’t you going to chase us, Kitty?”	38
6203	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	6	“Lackaday, lackaday,” said Mr Grinling sadly.	39
6204	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	5	“Miaow, miaow,” agreed Hamish pitifully.	40
6205	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	15	On Wednesday evening Mr and Mrs Grinling racked their brains again for a new plan.	41
6206	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	7	“What shall we do?” said Mr Grinling.	42
6207	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	4	Mrs Grinling looked thoughtful.	43
6208	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	3	“I have it!”	44
6209	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	2	she exclaimed.	45
6210	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	5	“Just the mixture-for hungry seagulls.”	46
6211	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	6	“Indeed, my dear,” said Mr Grinling.	47
6212	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	5	“What have you in mind?”	48
6213	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	10	“Wait and see,” said Mrs Grinling, “just wait and see.”	49
6214	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	5	“Mustard sandwiches,” chuckled Mr Grinling.	50
6215	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	8	“A truly superb plan my dear, truly superb.”	51
6216	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	21	On Thursday morning Mrs Grinling carefully packed the mustard sandwiches and sent them off down the wire to the expectant seagulls.	52
6217	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	1	“Yuk!”	53
6218	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	1	“Ugh!!”	54
6219	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	1	“Aaaak!”	55
6220	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	8	On Friday Mrs Grinling repeated the mustard mixture.	56
6221	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	7	“It’s the same as yesterday’s lunch Fred.”	57
6222	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	9	“All right, boys, let’s go and have lunch elsewhere.”	58
6223	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	30	So, on Saturday, up in the little white cottage on the cliffs, a jubilant Mrs Grinling put away the mustard pot before she prepared a scrumptious lunch for Mr Grinling.	59
6224	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	30	While he waited for his lunch down in the lighthouse on the rocks, Mr Grinling sang snatches of old sea shanties as he surveyed the coastline through his telescope... ...	60
6225	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	6	and this is what he saw..	61
6226	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	6	“No mustard in this lot Tom.”	62
6227	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	7	“This is a delicious chocolate éclair, Fred.”	63
6228	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	9	“We’ll fly back here for lunch again tomorrow, Boys.”	64
6229	The Lighthouse Keeper's Lunch	21	“Ah well, such is life,” mused Mr Grinling as he sat down to enjoy a leisurely lunch in the warm sunshine.	65
6230	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	7	My dog is not like other dogs.	0
6231	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	19	He doesn’t do dog stuff like weeing on lampposts, or scratching his fleas, or drinking out of the toilet.	1
6232	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	6	If I throw him a stick.	2
6233	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	7	he looks at me like I’m crazy.	3
6234	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	7	So I have to fetch it myself.	4
6235	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	12	No, my dog likes music and moonlight and walking on his tiptoes.	5
6236	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	9	You see, my dog doesn’t think he’s a dog...	6
6237	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	6	My dog thinks he’s a ballerina!	7
6238	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	28	When I get ready for ballet class, he looks longingly at my tutu and ballet shoes and I just know he is dreaming of his name in lights.	8
6239	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	3	“Dad,” I say.	9
6240	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	4	“Can Biff come too?	10
6241	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	3	He loves ballet.”	11
6242	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	5	"“Not a chance,"" says Dad."	12
6243	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	4	“Dogs don’t do ballet!”	13
6244	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	13	Then, one Saturday on my way to class, I get a funny feeling.	14
6245	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	8	A funny feeling that I am being watched.	15
6246	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	8	A funny feeling that I am being followed.	16
6247	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	19	When Miss Polly is teaching us a new routine, I think I see something peeking in at the window.	17
6248	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	5	Something with a wet nose.	18
6249	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	4	Something with a tail.	19
6250	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	5	“Right girls,” says Miss Polly.	20
6251	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	6	“Who’s going to demonstrate first position?”	21
6252	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	24	But, before anyone can step forward, there is a loud bark from the back of the hall and something furry rushes to the front.	22
6253	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	10	“What is this?” asks Miss Polly, peering over her glasses.	23
6254	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	6	“This,” I say, “is my dog.”	24
6255	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	13	“Well take it away at once,” says Miss Polly, wrinkling up her nose.	25
6256	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	4	“Dogs don’t do ballet!”	26
6257	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	15	My poor dog stops wagging his tail and his ears droop down at the ends.	27
6258	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	12	I take my dog home and give him a bowl of Doggie-Donuts.	28
6259	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	5	But he won’t touch them.	29
6260	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	18	He just stays in his kennel for days and days, and at night he howls at the moon.	30
6261	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	10	For my birthday I get tickets for the Royal Ballet.	31
6262	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	4	“Can Biff come too?”	32
6263	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	3	I ask Dad.	33
6264	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	3	“He loves ballet.	34
6265	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	10	My dog pricks up his ears and wags his tail.	35
6266	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	3	“No,” says Dad.	36
6267	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	15	"“If I’ve told you once, I’ve told you a thousand times: dogs don’t do ballet!"""	37
6268	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	21	As we wait for the bus I think about my poor old dog, all on his own, howling at the moon.	38
6269	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	6	Then I get a funny feeling.	39
6270	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	8	A funny feeling that I am being watched.	40
6271	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	8	A funny feeling that I am not alone.	41
6272	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	4	The ballet is magical!	42
6273	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	17	The orchestra plays as the prima ballerina dances and prances, and twirls and whirls, and skips and...	43
6274	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	2	Oh, no!	44
6275	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	2	She trips!	45
6276	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	1	Disaster!	46
6277	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	1	Calamity!	47
6278	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	3	"“It’s all over!"""	48
6279	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	2	I think.	49
6280	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	7	But somebody doesn’t think it is over.	50
6281	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	7	No, somebody thinks it is just beginning.	51
6282	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	15	Somebody with big black eyes, somebody with pointy ears, somebody ... ... wearing my tutu!	52
6283	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	3	The audience gasps.	53
6284	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	3	“It’s a dog!”	54
6285	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	2	someone shouts.	55
6286	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	4	“Dogs don’t do ballet!”	56
6287	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	10	My dog turns bright red and looks at his feet.	57
6288	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	7	“That’s what I’ve always said,” Dad mutters.	58
6289	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	8	But then the orchestra starts to play... ...	59
6290	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	11	and my dog dances like no dog has ever danced before.	60
6291	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	3	Plie! Jete! Arabesque!	61
6292	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	1	Pirouette!	62
6293	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	7	He is as light as a sugarpuff!	63
6294	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	5	As pretty as a fairy!	64
6295	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	5	The audience can’t believe it.	65
6296	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	1	“Hooray!”	66
6297	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	2	I shout.	67
6298	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	3	“That’s my dog!	68
6299	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	16	When the music stops, my dog gives a hopeful curtsey and blinks nervously into the spotlight.	69
6300	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	22	The theatre is so very quiet that you could hear a bubble pop Then the lady in the front row stands up.	70
6301	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	3	“It’s a dog!”	71
6302	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	2	she shouts.	72
6303	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	7	Biff s ears start to droop again.	73
6304	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	5	‘A dog that does ballet!”	74
6305	Dogs Don't Do Ballet	2	she adds.	75

6579	Hippo Owns Up	10	It was Tuesday and Hippo was having a bad day.	0
6580	Hippo Owns Up	5	He had got up late.	1
6581	Hippo Owns Up	4	He had missed breakfast.	2
6582	Hippo Owns Up	6	He was late for school, too.	3
6583	Hippo Owns Up	4	Miss Bird was cross.	4
6584	Hippo Owns Up	10	Then Miss Bird gave him lots of sums to do.	5
6585	Hippo Owns Up	8	But Hippo was too hungry to do them.	6
6586	Hippo Owns Up	5	Hippo looked at the clock.	7
6587	Hippo Owns Up	4	It was nearly lunchtime.	8
6588	Hippo Owns Up	10	Mrs Croc always made chocolate cake for lunch on Tuesdays.	9
6589	Hippo Owns Up	11	She always put lots of chocolate icing on the top, too.	10
6590	Hippo Owns Up	10	Hippo thought about the chocolate cake and the chocolate icing.	11
6591	Hippo Owns Up	4	His tummy rumbled loudly.	12
6592	Hippo Owns Up	2	Everyone heard.	13
6593	Hippo Owns Up	2	Everyone giggled.	14
6594	Hippo Owns Up	10	Miss Bird told them to get on with their work.	15
6595	Hippo Owns Up	14	But the more Hippo thought about the chocolate cake, the louder his tummy rumbled.	16
6596	Hippo Owns Up	5	Then he got the hiccups!	17
6597	Hippo Owns Up	6	The hiccups were very, very loud.	18
6598	Hippo Owns Up	2	Everyone laughed.	19
6599	Hippo Owns Up	4	Miss Bird got cross.	20
6600	Hippo Owns Up	6	She said Hippo was disturbing everyone.	21
6601	Hippo Owns Up	14	She told him to go to the kitchen to get a drink of water.	22
6602	Hippo Owns Up	5	Hippo went to the kitchen.	23
6603	Hippo Owns Up	8	The big chocolate cake was on the table.	24
6604	Hippo Owns Up	7	He went to get a closer look.	25
6605	Hippo Owns Up	3	It looked Delicious.	26
6606	Hippo Owns Up	3	It smelled DELICIOUS.	27
6607	Hippo Owns Up	9	He decided to try a tiny bit of it.	28
6608	Hippo Owns Up	11	He picked up a spoon and took a bit of cake.	29
6609	Hippo Owns Up	3	It tasted wonderful!	30
6610	Hippo Owns Up	5	Hippo stared at the cake.	31
6611	Hippo Owns Up	12	Now there was a little hole on one side of the cake.	32
6612	Hippo Owns Up	9	He tried to smooth the icing over the hole.	33
6613	Hippo Owns Up	4	But it looked worse.	34
6614	Hippo Owns Up	14	He took some cake from the other side to try to even it up.	35
6615	Hippo Owns Up	6	But it looked WORSE than before.	36
6616	Hippo Owns Up	3	Hippo was WORRIED.	37
6617	Hippo Owns Up	8	He wanted to make the cake look better.	38
6618	Hippo Owns Up	6	He took more and more cake.	39
6619	Hippo Owns Up	12	It tasted delicious, but the more he took, the worse it looked.	40
6620	Hippo Owns Up	8	Soon there was no cake left at all!	41
6621	Hippo Owns Up	5	Hippo went back to class.	42
6622	Hippo Owns Up	9	Miss Bird said he had been a long time.	43
6623	Hippo Owns Up	9	She told him to get on with his sums.	44
6624	Hippo Owns Up	9	But Hippo could not get on with his sums.	45
6625	Hippo Owns Up	10	His tummy felt too full and he felt too sick.	46
6626	Hippo Owns Up	8	He felt bad for eating all the cake.	47
6627	Hippo Owns Up	7	Just then the bell rang for lunchtime.	48
6628	Hippo Owns Up	3	Everyone lined up.	49
6629	Hippo Owns Up	7	But Mrs Croc had some bad news.	50
6630	Hippo Owns Up	12	She said there was no chocolate cake because it had all gone.	51
6631	Hippo Owns Up	10	She said Hattie, the school cat, must have eaten it.	52
6632	Hippo Owns Up	7	She said Hattie was a bad cat.	53
6633	Hippo Owns Up	3	Hippo said nothing.	54
6634	Hippo Owns Up	9	Everyone ate their lunch, but Hippo was not hungry.	55
6635	Hippo Owns Up	6	He was not hungry at all.	56
6636	Hippo Owns Up	4	Mrs Croc was worried.	57
6637	Hippo Owns Up	10	Hippo was always hungry and he always ate his lunch.	58
6638	Hippo Owns Up	6	She thought he must be ill.	59
6639	Hippo Owns Up	6	She sent him to Miss Bird.	60
6640	Hippo Owns Up	8	Hippo told Miss Bird about the chocolate cake.	61
6641	Hippo Owns Up	10	He told her that he had eaten it, not Hattie.	62
6642	Hippo Owns Up	19	Miss Bird said that he should not have eaten the cake but that he was brave to own up.	63
6643	Hippo Owns Up	14	She said he should have a good think about how to put things right.	64
6644	Hippo Owns Up	5	Hippo had a good think.	65
6645	Hippo Owns Up	15	He told Miss Bird he had to say sorry to everyone for eating the cake.	66
6646	Hippo Owns Up	12	He said he had a good idea to put things right, too.	67
6647	Hippo Owns Up	7	He told Miss Bird his good idea.	68
6648	Hippo Owns Up	8	She said it was a very good one.	69
6649	Hippo Owns Up	6	Hippo said sorry to everyone -	70
6650	Hippo Owns Up	6	He said sorry to Mrs Croc.	71
6651	Hippo Owns Up	8	He said sorry to Hattie the cat, too!	72
6652	Hippo Owns Up	18	Then Hippo asked Mrs Croc if she would help him to bake a new chocolate cake for everyone.	73
6653	Hippo Owns Up	7	Mrs Croc gave him lots of help.	74
6654	Hippo Owns Up	6	Hippo baked a very good cake.	75
6655	Hippo Owns Up	10	It had lots of chocolate icing on the top, too.	76
6656	Hippo Owns Up	7	Soon the cake was ready to eat.	77
6657	Hippo Owns Up	7	Everyone went to get a closer look.	78
6658	Hippo Owns Up	3	It looked delicious.	79
6659	Hippo Owns Up	3	It smelled delicious.	80
6660	Hippo Owns Up	6	Everyone took a bit of cake.	81
6661	Hippo Owns Up	3	It tasted wonderful!	82
6662	Hippo Owns Up	3	Hippo was pleased.	83
6663	Hippo Owns Up	13	Hippo said he was glad he had owned up and put things right.	84
6664	Hippo Owns Up	11	Then Mrs Croc asked him if he would like some cake.	85
6665	Hippo Owns Up	7	Hippo said he did not want any.	86
6666	Hippo Owns Up	11	He said he did not want any chocolate cake ever again!	87

6734	Elmer on Stilts	11	One morning, Elmer, the patchwork elephant, met some of his friends.	0
6735	Elmer on Stilts	5	They were looking very worried.	1
6736	Elmer on Stilts	5	“Oh dear, Elmer” they said.	2
6737	Elmer on Stilts	6	“Those awful elephant hunters are coming.	3
6738	Elmer on Stilts	7	What can we do to escape them?”	4
6739	Elmer on Stilts	3	“Hmmmm!” said Elmer.	5
6740	Elmer on Stilts	5	“Let me have a think.	6
6741	Elmer on Stilts	8	I’m sure I can come up with something.	7
6742	Elmer on Stilts	6	Elmer went for a thinking walk.	8
6743	Elmer on Stilts	26	He was thinking about how hunters look for elephant footprints and follow them until they find the elephants when suddenly a voice said, “Look out, Elmer!	9
6744	Elmer on Stilts	4	Watch where you’re going.”	10
6745	Elmer on Stilts	8	A very tall giraffe was speaking to him.	11
6746	Elmer on Stilts	3	“Sorry,” said Elmer.	12
6747	Elmer on Stilts	6	“I didn’t see you up there.	13
6748	Elmer on Stilts	18	But you’ve just given me a very good idea,” and he hurried off to find the other elephants.	14
6749	Elmer on Stilts	8	“I’ve an idea” said Elmer to the others.	15
6750	Elmer on Stilts	5	“Let’s walk around on stilts.”	16
6751	Elmer on Stilts	10	“This is no time for jokes, Elmer,” said an elephant.	17
6752	Elmer on Stilts	4	“The hunters are coming.”	18
6753	Elmer on Stilts	4	“I’m serious,” said Elmer.	19
6754	Elmer on Stilts	8	“Hunters look for us by following our footprints.	20
6755	Elmer on Stilts	7	They’d never look up and see us.	21
6756	Elmer on Stilts	16	The elephants thought that Elmer’s idea was a good one and were soon hard at work.	22
6757	Elmer on Stilts	7	Some made stilts from very strong wood.	23
6758	Elmer on Stilts	20	Other elephants brought tree trunks and made a ramp that the elephants could walk up to get onto the stilts.	24
6759	Elmer on Stilts	3	Elmer went first.	25
6760	Elmer on Stilts	21	He walked up the ramp and using his front legs to hold on he put his back legs onto the stilts.	26
6761	Elmer on Stilts	4	“It’s easy” he called.	27
6762	Elmer on Stilts	7	“My trunk helps me keep my balance.”	28
6763	Elmer on Stilts	13	Unfortunately, because Elmer was so heavy the stilts immediately sank into the ground.	29
6764	Elmer on Stilts	5	“Oh no,” groaned the elephants.	30
6765	Elmer on Stilts	3	“It won’t work.”	31
6766	Elmer on Stilts	4	“I know,” said Elmer.	32
6767	Elmer on Stilts	20	“If we put flat pieces of wood on the bottom of the poles, the stilts won’t sink into the ground.”	33
6768	Elmer on Stilts	16	“Then if we colour the stilts green” continued Elmer, “the hunters will think they are plants.	34
6769	Elmer on Stilts	9	We can shape the flat bits like monsters’ feet.	35
6770	Elmer on Stilts	22	If we put them on backwards, as we walk it will look like a monster’s trail, but going in the opposite direction.	36
6771	Elmer on Stilts	15	The hunters will follow the footprints away from us to try and find the monsters.”	37
6772	Elmer on Stilts	1	w	38
6773	Elmer on Stilts	19	It wasn’t long before the elephants were walking on stilts leaving a trail of prints pointing away from them.	39
6774	Elmer on Stilts	15	The more the hunters look, the further they will get away from us,” chuckled Elmer.	40
6775	Elmer on Stilts	9	There was one thing, however, that Elmer had forgotten.	41
6776	Elmer on Stilts	4	Elephant hunters are cowards.	42
6777	Elmer on Stilts	12	When they saw the footprints, the hunters all said the same thing.	43
6778	Elmer on Stilts	3	Oh no, monsters!”	44
6779	Elmer on Stilts	17	Then, shaking with fear, they hurried off in the opposite direction towards the elephants - and.... ...	45
6780	Elmer on Stilts	1	CRASH!	46
6781	Elmer on Stilts	31	They didn’t notice the stilts and bumped right into them - The elephants fell off, but, instead of falling onto the hard ground, they fell onto the soft, round, fat hunters.	47
6782	Elmer on Stilts	12	One by one, Elmer and the elephants got up and walked away.	48
6783	Elmer on Stilts	5	“Dear, oh dear” they said.	49
6784	Elmer on Stilts	13	It was a long time before the hunters managed to crawl away, moaning.	50
6785	Elmer on Stilts	5	They would never come back.	51
6786	Elmer on Stilts	6	“Hurrah for Elmer!” shouted the elephants.	52
6787	Elmer on Stilts	4	“His idea saved us.	53
6788	Elmer on Stilts	8	Now we don’t need the stilts any more.”	54
6789	Elmer on Stilts	6	“We don’t NEED them” smiled Elmer.	55
6790	Elmer on Stilts	8	“But we could have some fun on them.”	56
6791	Elmer on Stilts	6	And that’s exactly what they did.	57

6886	The Tree That's Meant To Be	8	I am the tree that's meant to be.	0
6887	The Tree That's Meant To Be	27	I started life as a tiny seed, but seen enough it was plain to see that I was never ever going to be a perfect, grown-up tree!	1
6888	The Tree That's Meant To Be	2	W b..	2
6889	The Tree That's Meant To Be	19	I branched a bit to the left, too much to the right, and didn’t really focus on my height.	3
6890	The Tree That's Meant To Be	10	While other trees grew poised and tall, I lagged behind.	4
6891	The Tree That's Meant To Be	2	Looking wonky.	5
6892	The Tree That's Meant To Be	2	feeling small.	6
6893	The Tree That's Meant To Be	1	Spring.	7
6894	The Tree That's Meant To Be	1	Summer.	8
6895	The Tree That's Meant To Be	1	Autumn.	9
6896	The Tree That's Meant To Be	5	Seasons came, stayed, and went.	10
6897	The Tree That's Meant To Be	11	Then one harsh, cold, winter night, the forest turned... snowy white.	11
6898	The Tree That's Meant To Be	13	Then people came with measuring tapes and saws, searching for a flawless tree.	12
6899	The Tree That's Meant To Be	8	A Christmas tree to cut and take indoors!	13
6900	The Tree That's Meant To Be	9	Soon, one by one, the other trees were gone.	14
6901	The Tree That's Meant To Be	5	It was just me, now.	15
6902	The Tree That's Meant To Be	1	Alone.	16
6903	The Tree That's Meant To Be	4	I shivered, I shuddered.	17
6904	The Tree That's Meant To Be	3	'I-i-i-is anyone there?’	18
6905	The Tree That's Meant To Be	11	I stuttered into the night But who would hear my cry?	19
6906	The Tree That's Meant To Be	11	Who could speak the language of the trees and understand me?	20
6907	The Tree That's Meant To Be	3	And understand me.	21
6908	The Tree That's Meant To Be	8	'Am I the tree that’s meant to be?’	22
6909	The Tree That's Meant To Be	10	And then, at dawn, a fox, a deer a bird.	23
6910	The Tree That's Meant To Be	3	They had heard!	24
6911	The Tree That's Meant To Be	7	Everyone brought berries, feathers, nuts, and flowers.	25

6914	The Tree That's Meant To Be	3	Hello!' 'Welcome, squirrel.	28
6915	The Tree That's Meant To Be	2	Greetings, bear!’	29
6916	The Tree That's Meant To Be	4	Laughter filled the air.	30
6917	The Tree That's Meant To Be	6	My clearing rang with Christmas cheer.	31
6918	The Tree That's Meant To Be	8	As darkness fell, a falling star dropped down.	32
6919	The Tree That's Meant To Be	17	It sank into my branches and shone pure, so bright, that I became a tree of light.	33
6920	The Tree That's Meant To Be	9	Among the creatures great and small, I felt loved.	34

6927	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	17	From high in the sky Santa looked down below To houses all cosy and covered in snow.	0
6928	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	18	Where snoozers were snoozing, tucked up in their beds Whilst dreaming the most festive dreams in their heads.	1
6929	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	34	But one boy called Danny, a greedy young chap, The greediest chap on the planet in fact, Was lying awake on his mountain of toys, Which stood even taller than most girls and boys.	2
6930	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	18	But that wasn't enough, Danny still wanted more, He wanted much more than his toy box could store.	3
6931	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	19	"So big Santy C said, ""I'll leave him a present, But this year his present might just be unpleasant?"	4
6932	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	18	Danny heard such a clatter, his heart skipped a thump - ’Twas the clopping of hooves going clippety-clump.	5
6933	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	18	He bounced out of bed and threw on some clothes And crept down the stairs on his tip-tippy-toes.	6
6934	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	9	There, under the tree, were gifts big and small.	7
6935	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	10	And a Gimungus egg placed in front of them all.	8
6936	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	2	"""An egg?!"""	9
6937	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	2	Danny said.	10
6938	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	5	“Santa brought me an egg?!	11
6939	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	6	j; Then out with a crack!	12
6940	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	4	popped a dinosaur’s head!	13
6941	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	1	I'W--	14
6942	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	16	It wasted no time on that cold Christmas morning, And started to eat everything without warning.	15
6943	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	18	It swallowed the stockings and Christmas cards too, The red fairy lights, then the green and the blue.	16
6944	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	16	There wasn't a single thing Danny could do, Except sit and watch as the dinosaur chewed.	17
6945	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	11	It chewed and it munched and it crunched on Kris Kringle	18
6946	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	10	The reindeer, the sleigh bells and all things that jingle.	19
6947	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	20	But it didn’t stop there, there were more things to gobble, Much more than the small shiny baubles that bobble.	20
6948	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	19	It ate up the cat and the dog and the fish, And from the dishwasher it downed every dish.	21
6949	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	18	The tables, the chairs, the walls and the doors - Now nothing was safe, not even the floors.	22
6950	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	18	Danny's poor granny was knitting some socks, But the dino had no need for socks, it had lots!	23
6951	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	18	So it slurped up her knitting like strings of spaghetti And gobbled up Granny along with the settee.	24
6952	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	31	Then it ate Danny's mum, she was gone in one bite, And although Danny's dad tried to put up a fight, The dino had grown to the size of King Kong.	25
6953	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	10	With a gulp and a burp Danny’s father was gone.	26
6954	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	19	Now nothing was left - all Danny could see Was a fat dinosaur where his home used to be.	27
6955	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	18	And so, with the thought of no Christmas this year, His tears turned to snowflakes and then disappeared.	28
6956	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	17	With the feeling of guilt in the dinosaur's gut, Its brain brewed a plan involving its butt.	29
6957	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	13	It knew there was only one thing it could do: To put Christmas	30
6958	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	6	right it needed to ... POO!	31
6959	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	19	It pooped out the turkey, the toys and the telly, And even the tinsel was now brown and smelly.	32
6960	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	18	It pooped all the presents and pieces of puzzles, It pooped all the things it had previously guzzled.	33
6961	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	9	And then Father Christmas yelled “OUT OF THE WAY!	34
6962	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	10	As he flew from the dinosaur's bum on his sleigh.	35
6963	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	15	The dinosaur finally gave a huge push And pooped Danny's parents in one massive Whooooooosh!	36
6964	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	14	Last, but not least, and never forgotten, Granny plopped out of the dinosaur's bottom.	37
6965	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	19	“Merry Christmas,’ said Dan to his whole family As they washed off the presents and put up the tree.	38
6966	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	18	And the greedy young chap that you saw just before Promised next Christmas he'd not ask for more.	39
6967	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	12	And the dinosaur promised he’d not eat a crumb ... . .	40
6968	The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas	10	as you would if Christmas came out of your bumf	41

6999	Lion's in a Flap	11	The next day, Lion worried about the rides at Jungle Land.	30
7000	Lion's in a Flap	13	What if he was too small to go on them... or too big?	31

7003	Lion's in a Flap	4	"""Lion's in a flap!"""	34
7004	Lion's in a Flap	2	everyone said.	35
7005	Lion's in a Flap	8	Miss Bird took Lion outside to calm down.	36
7006	Lion's in a Flap	7	Miss Bird asked Lion what was wrong.	37
7007	Lion's in a Flap	11	He told her all his worries about the Big Day Out.	38
7008	Lion's in a Flap	4	Miss Bird listened carefully.	39
7009	Lion's in a Flap	14	She told him that when she felt worried she always took a deep breath.	40
7010	Lion's in a Flap	5	Lion took a deep breath.	41
7011	Lion's in a Flap	5	He felt a little better.	42
7012	Lion's in a Flap	26	Then Miss Bird told him to think about all the good things that might happen on the Big Day Out, instead of all the bad things.	43
7013	Lion's in a Flap	5	Lion had a good think.	44
7014	Lion's in a Flap	5	He thought about the minibus.	45

7019	Lion's in a Flap	4	Lion felt much better.	50
7020	Lion's in a Flap	6	Then he thought about the weather.	51
7021	Lion's in a Flap	15	There were no clouds in the sky and it hadn't rained for weeks and weeks.	52
7022	Lion's in a Flap	11	It might not rain at all on the Big Day Out.	53

7032	Lion's in a Flap	20	And it only rained in the afternoon when & everyone was on the Water Ride, so it didn’t matter anyway.	63
7033	Lion's in a Flap	18	Lion was a bit too big to go on the Runaway Train, but he didn’t mind at all.	64
7034	Lion's in a Flap	13	He went on the Roaring Rocket instead and that was even more fun!	65
7035	Lion's in a Flap	7	Then Miss Bird looked at her watch.	66

7038	Lion's in a Flap	4	Everyone was very excited.	69
7039	Lion's in a Flap	5	But Lion began to worry.	70
7040	Lion's in a Flap	10	What if the ride was too high and too fast?	71
7041	Lion's in a Flap	6	What if it was too scary?	72
7042	Lion's in a Flap	12	Worse still, what if he could not sit next to his friends?	73
7043	Lion's in a Flap	5	That would be really horrid!	74
7044	Lion's in a Flap	9	Then Lion remembered what Miss Bird had told him.	75
7045	Lion's in a Flap	5	He took a deep breath.	76
7046	Lion's in a Flap	5	He felt a bit better.	77

7057	How to Catch a Star	12	Once there was a boy and the boy loved stars very much.	0
7058	How to Catch a Star	18	Every night the boy watched the stars from his window And wished he had one of very own.	1
7059	How to Catch a Star	9	He dreamed how this star might be his friend.	2
7060	How to Catch a Star	9	They would play hide-and-go-seek And take long walks together.	3
7061	How to Catch a Star	10	The boy decided he would try to catch a star.	4
7062	How to Catch a Star	27	He thought that getting up early in the morning would be best, because then the star would be tired From being up in the sky all night.	5
7063	How to Catch a Star	9	So, the next day he set out at sunrise.	6
7064	How to Catch a Star	8	But he could not see a star anywhere.	7
7065	How to Catch a Star	9	He sat down and waited for one to appear.	8
7066	How to Catch a Star	11	He waited ... and he waited … and ate lunch. ...	9
7067	How to Catch a Star	2	and waited.	10
7068	How to Catch a Star	7	And after dinner he waited some more.	11
7069	How to Catch a Star	14	Finally, just before the sun was about to go away, he saw a star.	12
7070	How to Catch a Star	9	The boy tried to jump up and grab it.	13
7071	How to Catch a Star	7	But he could not jump high enough.	14
7072	How to Catch a Star	15	So, very carefully, he climbed to the top of the tallest tree he could find.	15
7073	How to Catch a Star	9	But the star was still way out of reach.	16
7074	How to Catch a Star	15	He thought he might lasso the star with the life belt from his father's boat.	17
7075	How to Catch a Star	10	But it was much too heavy for him to carry.	18
7076	How to Catch a Star	14	He thought he could fly up in his spaceship and just grab the star.	19
7077	How to Catch a Star	16	But his spaceship had run out of petrol last Tuesday when he flew to the moon.	20
7078	How to Catch a Star	18	Perhaps he could get a seagull to help him fly up into the sky to reach his star?	21
7079	How to Catch a Star	13	But the only seagull he could find didn’t want to help at all.	22
7080	How to Catch a Star	9	The boy thought he would never catch a star.	23
7081	How to Catch a Star	9	Just then he noticed something floating in the water.	24
7082	How to Catch a Star	9	It was the prettiest star he had ever seen.	25
7083	How to Catch a Star	4	Just a baby star.	26
7084	How to Catch a Star	7	It must have fallen from the sky.	27
7085	How to Catch a Star	15	He tried to fish the star out with his hands, But he couldn’t reach it.	28
7086	How to Catch a Star	5	Then he had an idea.	29
7087	How to Catch a Star	8	The star might wash up on the shore.	30
7088	How to Catch a Star	9	He ran back along the jetty to the beach.	31
7089	How to Catch a Star	21	Then he waited and walked ...and watched and waited... …and sure enough the star washed up on the bright, golden sand.	32
7090	How to Catch a Star	6	The boy had caught a star.	33
7091	How to Catch a Star	6	A star of his very own.	34
7092	The Very Busy Spider	11	Early one morning, the wind blew a spider across the field.	0
7093	The Very Busy Spider	8	A thin, silky thread trailed from her body.	1
7094	The Very Busy Spider	20	The spider landed on a fence post near a farmyard and began to spin a web with her silky thread.	2

7130	The Very Busy Spider	5	Whoo? Whoo?” asked the owl.	38
7131	The Very Busy Spider	5	Who built this beautiful web?”	39
7132	The Very Busy Spider	4	The spider didn’t answer.	40
7133	The Very Busy Spider	4	She had fallen asleep.	41
7134	The Very Busy Spider	8	It had been a very, very busy day.	42
7135	The Detective Dog	12	There once was a d og with a keen sense of smell.	0
7136	The Detective Dog	10	She was known far and wide as Detective Dog Nell.	1
7137	The Detective Dog	3	Sniff, sniff, sniff!	2
7138	The Detective Dog	10	Time after time, Nell the Detective solved crime after crime.	3
7139	The Detective Dog	8	Who threw the hazelnuts down from the trees?	4
7140	The Detective Dog	8	Who took the honey away from the bees?	5
7141	The Detective Dog	9	Who did the poo on the new gravel path?	6
7142	The Detective Dog	8	How did the spider get into the bath?	7
7143	The Detective Dog	3	Sniff, sniff, sniff!	8
7144	The Detective Dog	15	With a wag of he r tail, Nell the Detective was hot on the trail.	9
7145	The Detective Dog	19	Nell shared her house with a person called Peter, A very nice child, though he could have been neater.	10
7146	The Detective Dog	17	And six-year-old Peter was one of those boys Who kept on mislaying his clothes and his toys.	11
7147	The Detective Dog	4	S niff, sniff, sniff!	12
7148	The Detective Dog	40	Nose to the ground, These are the things the Detective Dog found: The bus in the bowl an d the book in the bed, The sock in the sofa, the shoe in the shed, The tumbledown teddy, the bounce-away ball.	13
7149	The Detective Dog	6	Nell the Detective discovered them all.	14
7150	The Detective Dog	15	Now Nell did detection from Tuesday till Sunday, But did something totally different each Monday.	15
7151	The Detective Dog	21	She found Peter’s bag and she tracked down he r lead, Then set off for school, where she heard children read.	16
7152	The Detective Dog	18	The children loved reading their stories to Nell, And Nell loved to listen - and also to smell.	17
7153	The Detective Dog	3	Sniff, sniff, sniff!	18
7154	The Detective Dog	34	Mixed in the air Were plasticine, custard and newly washed hair, The crusts in the bins and the coats on the hooks, But the best smell of all was the smell of the books.	19
7155	The Detective Dog	27	Books about dinosaurs, books about knights, Books about planets and meteorites, Books about princes who turned into fr ogs, Books about dragons - and books about dogs!	20
7156	The Detective Dog	11	But then cam e a Monday when all was not well.	21
7157	The Detective Dog	10	Nell sniffed the air, and she smelled the wrong smell.	22
7158	The Detective Dog	15	Into the classroom the two of them hurried And found Mr Jones looking terribly worried.	23
7159	The Detective Dog	11	He tugged at his hair and he let out a sigh.	24
7160	The Detective Dog	8	Peter looked round and he started to cry.	25
7161	The Detective Dog	3	Sniff, sniff, sniff!	26
7162	The Detective Dog	4	What was going on?	27
7163	The Detective Dog	5	“The books!” cried out Peter.	28
7164	The Detective Dog	5	“The books have all gone!”	29
7165	The Detective Dog	19	Nell gave a growl w hen she heard the bad news, But then started sniffing and searching for clues.	30
7166	The Detective Dog	3	Sniff, sniff, sniff!	31
7167	The Detective Dog	6	On the bookshelf, a ca p!	32
7168	The Detective Dog	9	The thief must have dropped it, the terrible chap.	33
7169	The Detective Dog	12	Nell sniffed the cap, then she tugged on the lead, And, Woof!	34
7170	The Detective Dog	6	She was off at astonishing speed.	35
7171	The Detective Dog	5	Everyone followed Detective Dog Nell.	36
7172	The Detective Dog	7	She stopped at the traffic light s.	37
7173	The Detective Dog	4	What could she smell?	38
7174	The Detective Dog	3	Sniff, sniff, sniff!	39
7175	The Detective Dog	27	Haddock and hay, Pizza and penguins, and f urther away The smell of the thief, and - how very exciting Thousands of pages, all covered in writing!	40
7176	The Detective Dog	2	Then, Woof!	41
7177	The Detective Dog	19	They were off, with no time for a stop, past the farm… and the zoo… and the takeaway shop.	42
7178	The Detective Dog	18	They raced through a field (where rabbits smelled good), then over a golf course and into a wood.	43
7179	The Detective Dog	19	They thrashed through the undergrowth, leafy and dense, till they came to a gate in an old wooden fence.	44
7180	The Detective Dog	9	Then Nell started growling and pricked up an ear.	45
7181	The Detective Dog	11	She barked, and the bark meant, “The thief is in here.”	46
7182	The Detective Dog	10	They flung the gate open, and Peter crie d, “Look!”	47
7183	The Detective Dog	11	For there sat a man with his nose in a book.	48
7184	The Detective Dog	19	There were man y more books poking out of a sack, And the children yelled, “Those are OUR books!	49
7185	The Detective Dog	3	Give them back!”	50
7186	The Detective Dog	3	Sniff, sniff, sniff!	51
7187	The Detective Dog	5	The book thief looked sad.	52
7188	The Detective Dog	4	“I’m sorry,” he sniffled.	53
7189	The Detective Dog	5	“I know I’ve been bad.	54
7190	The Detective Dog	10	Stealing is wrong - but I just meant to borrow.	55
7191	The Detective Dog	10	I was planning to give all the books back tomorrow.”	56
7192	The Detective Dog	2	To borrow?	57
7193	The Detective Dog	2	To borrow?	58
7194	The Detective Dog	5	Nell pricked up an ear.	59
7195	The Detective Dog	10	She barked, and the bark meant, “I’ve had an idea.”	60
7196	The Detective Dog	2	Then, Woof.	61
7197	The Detective Dog	17	She was off, and away they all sped, Including the book thief (who told them, “I’m Ted.”)	62
7198	The Detective Dog	4	Sniff, sniff, sn iff!	63
7199	The Detective Dog	14	They raced through the wood and over the field where the rabbits smelled good.	64
7200	The Detective Dog	35	They p anted and puffed past the takeaway shop, The zoo and the farmyard, with never a stop (Except to retrieve Peter’s scarf and his bal l which someone had thoughtfully placed on a wall)	65
7201	The Detective Dog	11	Till they cam e to a building with doors open wide.	66
7202	The Detective Dog	10	And what did they see when they all went inside?	67
7203	The Detective Dog	9	Thousands of books, from the floor to the ceiling.	68
7204	The Detective Dog	9	The books gave the thief the most heavenly feeling.	69
7205	The Detective Dog	4	He gazed in amazement.	70
7206	The Detective Dog	12	"""Where am I?” he said, And Peter replied, “In the library, Ted."	71
7207	The Detective Dog	12	You can join if you want to - there isn’t a fee,	72
7208	The Detective Dog	11	And then you can take lots of books out for free.”	73
7209	The Detective Dog	8	So Ted has a lovely new library card	74
7210	The Detective Dog	10	And he sits reading books in his little back yard.	75
7211	The Detective Dog	15	And when it’s Monday, Detective Do g Nell Visits the school with the wonderful smell.	76
7212	The Detective Dog	3	Sniff, sniff, sniff!	77

7282	The First Christmas	14	Long ago, in a town called Nazareth, there lived a young woman named Mary.	0
7283	The First Christmas	13	One day a great light appeared and the angel Gabriel stood before her.	1
7284	The First Christmas	7	“Do not be afraid,” said the angel.	2
7285	The First Christmas	5	“I bring you joyful news.	3
7286	The First Christmas	11	God has chosen you to be the mother of his son.	4
7287	The First Christmas	11	You will have a baby and you must call him Jesus.”	5
7288	The First Christmas	10	In the same town there lived a carpenter named Joseph.	6
7289	The First Christmas	5	Joseph loved Mary very much.	7
7290	The First Christmas	6	He was going to marry her.	8
7291	The First Christmas	17	The angel came to visit Joseph and told him that Mary was going to have God’s son.	9
7292	The First Christmas	14	Later Joseph came to see Mary and told her what the angel had said.	10
7293	The First Christmas	11	One dag a message came from the governor of the land.	11
7294	The First Christmas	21	All of the people had to go back to the place where they had been born so they could be counted.	12
7295	The First Christmas	3	Joseph was worried.	13
7296	The First Christmas	9	He and Mary would have to go to Bethlehem.	14
7297	The First Christmas	15	This was a long way away and Mary was almost ready to have her baby.	15
7298	The First Christmas	7	They set off early the next morning.	16
7299	The First Christmas	4	Joseph led the way.	17
7300	The First Christmas	5	Mary rode on a donkey.	18
7301	The First Christmas	6	The road was long and hard.	19
7302	The First Christmas	7	They didn’t reach Bethlehem until the evening.	20
7303	The First Christmas	6	The town was full of people.	21
7304	The First Christmas	15	Joseph tried everywhere to find a place to stay, but all the rooms were taken.	22
7305	The First Christmas	9	Mary was so tired she could hardly stay awake.	23
7306	The First Christmas	16	At last an innkeeper said, “All my rooms are full, but you can use my stable.	24
7307	The First Christmas	7	It is clean and warm in there.”	25
7308	The First Christmas	7	Joseph thanked him and they went inside.	26
7309	The First Christmas	9	All around them cows and donkeys lay peacefully asleep.	27
7310	The First Christmas	7	The hay was soft and smelled sweet.	28
7311	The First Christmas	7	Mary and Joseph lay down and rested.	29
7312	The First Christmas	9	In the night, Mary gave birth to her baby.	30
7313	The First Christmas	9	It was a boy as the angel had said.	31
7314	The First Christmas	4	They named him Jesus.	32
7315	The First Christmas	18	Mary wrapped him in a blanket and laid him in a manger, where it was soft and warm.	33
7316	The First Christmas	7	Mary and Joseph watched over Jesus lovingly.	34
7317	The First Christmas	8	They knew he was a very special baby.	35
7318	The First Christmas	14	Out on the hillside above the town, some shepherds were looking after their sheep.	36
7319	The First Christmas	11	Suddenly the sky was filled with light and an angel appeared.	37
7320	The First Christmas	8	The shepherds fell to the ground in fear.	38
7321	The First Christmas	8	But the angel said, “Do not be afraid.	39
7322	The First Christmas	5	I bring you good news.	40
7323	The First Christmas	5	Today a child is born.	41
7324	The First Christmas	6	He is the son of God.	42
7325	The First Christmas	10	You will find him in Bethlehem, lying in a manger.”	43
7326	The First Christmas	13	The shepherds gazed in wonder as the sky was filled with angels singing.	44
7327	The First Christmas	9	“We must go and find this child,” said one.	45
7328	The First Christmas	11	“We can take one of our newborn lambs as a gift.”	46
7329	The First Christmas	14	They went to Bethlehem and found Jesus in the stable with Mary and Joseph.	47
7330	The First Christmas	9	They fell to their knees and offered their gift.	48
7331	The First Christmas	10	Far away in an eastern land lived some wise men.	49
7332	The First Christmas	11	One night they saw a bright new star in the sky.	50
7333	The First Christmas	7	They wanted to know what it meant.	51
7334	The First Christmas	8	They looked in their books for the answer.	52
7335	The First Christmas	11	“It means that a new king has been born,” they said.	53
7336	The First Christmas	13	“We must go and look for him so that we can worship him.	54
7337	The First Christmas	5	The star will guide us.”	55
7338	The First Christmas	8	The wise men set off on their journey.	56
7339	The First Christmas	13	The star shone brightly in front of them by day and by night.	57
7340	The First Christmas	24	They came to the palace of King Herod who said to them, “You must find the new king then tell me where he is.”	58
7341	The First Christmas	6	King Herod was not very pleased.	59
7342	The First Christmas	9	The wise men followed the star for many miles.	60
7343	The First Christmas	9	It stopped right over the stable where Jesus lay.	61
7344	The First Christmas	9	“We are looking for the newborn king,” they said.	62
7345	The First Christmas	9	“A bright star has guided us from far away.”	63
7346	The First Christmas	6	Joseph led them into the stable.	64
7347	The First Christmas	16	They knelt before Jesus and offered him some very special gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.	65
7348	The First Christmas	12	The next day, the wise men set out for King Herod’s palace.	66
7349	The First Christmas	17	They stopped to rest and while they were asleep an angel came to them in a dream.	67
7350	The First Christmas	9	“Do not go back to Herod,” the angel warned.	68
7351	The First Christmas	8	“He does not want Jesus to be King.”	69
7352	The First Christmas	11	The wise men decided to go home a different way. ’	70
7353	The First Christmas	11	* *7 'S Mary and Joseph were very happy and proud.	71
7354	The First Christmas	10	They knew their baby was really the son of God.	72
7355	The First Christmas	19	They knew he was very special and that he would have important work to do when he grew up.	73
7356	The First Christmas	25	They also knew that Jesus would be loved throughout the world and that people would remember his birth as a time of happiness and peace.	74

7777	The Storm Whale	6	Noi wondered what he should do.	8

7805	Ravi's Roar	16	Everyone else got a comfy seat but Ravi had to squash in with Dad and Biscuits.	8
7806	Ravi's Roar	6	Then Biscuits made a bad smell.	9
7807	Ravi's Roar	9	When everyone got to the park, they played hide-and-seek.	10
7808	Ravi's Roar	11	It was meant to be fun but Ravi couldn’t find anyone.	11

7812	Ravi's Roar	20	Ravi got so cross that his face turned red, but then Dad said, “Come on, let’s get an ice cream!”	15
7813	Ravi's Roar	8	Everybody ran off and guess who came last?	16
7814	Ravi's Roar	1	Ravi.	17

7818	Ravi's Roar	3	Ravi was FURIOUS!	21
7819	Ravi's Roar	14	He growled... and a stripy tail popped out from the back of his shorts.	22
7820	Ravi's Roar	13	Then... he sprouted two furry ears, sharp, pointy teeth and stripy orange fur!	23
7821	Ravi's Roar	6	Ravi had turned into a TIGER!	24
7822	Ravi's Roar	10	The tiger took a huge, deep breath and then… ROARED!	25
7823	Ravi's Roar	13	Ravi’s brother looked a bit nervous and handed the tiger his ice cream.	26
7824	Ravi's Roar	16	When the tiger went to sit down there were no benches free so he ROARED ...	27
7825	Ravi's Roar	7	and everybody got out of the way.	28
7826	Ravi's Roar	6	It was GREAT being a tiger!	29
7827	Ravi's Roar	9	The tiger did all the things that Ravi couldn’t.	30

7829	Ravi's Roar	5	He leapt across the logs.	32
7830	Ravi's Roar	7	He even slid down the BIG slide!	33
7831	Ravi's Roar	6	Nobody dared to say NO ...	34
7832	Ravi's Roar	5	So the tiger went WILD!	35
7833	Ravi's Roar	10	He roared and growled and did exactly what he wanted.	36
7834	Ravi's Roar	11	But soon he found that nobody wanted to play with him.	37
7835	Ravi's Roar	12	Suddenly the tiger felt a bit sad and nowhere near as cross.	38
7836	Ravi's Roar	16	In fact, he couldn’t quite remember what had made him so angry in the first place.	39
7837	Ravi's Roar	18	“I’m sorry ...” said the tiger in a quiet voice and, when he said that, everything felt better.	40
7838	Ravi's Roar	4	“That’s okay,” said Dad.	41
7839	Ravi's Roar	5	“Well done for saying sorry!”	42
7840	Ravi's Roar	10	Then, without even realising, Ravi became a boy once more.	43
7841	Ravi's Roar	13	And that was the last time that Ravi ever turned into a tiger.	44
7842	Ravi's Roar	14	Although every now and then ... he did have a bit of a growl!	45

7850	The Runaway Pea	11	I might only be small but I want to have fun.”	7
7851	The Runaway Pea	12	The pea shot away with a skip and a hop ... ...	8
7852	The Runaway Pea	10	then into the dog bowl he fell with a PLOP!	9
7853	The Runaway Pea	3	Climb, little pea!	10
7854	The Runaway Pea	11	Climb up the side - QUICK, before Boris’s mouth opens wide!	11
7855	The Runaway Pea	13	The runaway pea jumped amazingly high and so nearly landed in Boris's eye!	12
7856	The Runaway Pea	19	He rolled along Boris's back in a flash, but a flick of the tail sent him flying off… SPLASH!	13
7857	The Runaway Pea	19	"“Where AM I?” he wondered, his head really hurt... ""Get out of my tank!” said Adele with a SQUIRT!"	14
7858	The Runaway Pea	20	He fell on a mousetrap, which snapped with a BANG… and bounced off a cobweb that stretched and went TWANG!	15
7859	The Runaway Pea	10	He came to a rest on a high, dusty shelf.	16
7860	The Runaway Pea	9	"""So far, so good!” smiled the pea to himself."	17
7861	The Runaway Pea	8	"""Surely there’s nothing else left to go wrong?”"	18
7862	The Runaway Pea	10	Then a fan started up and it blew him along.	19
7863	The Runaway Pea	8	And what’s that below with an orangey glow?	20
7864	The Runaway Pea	9	It’s the slot in the top of the toaster...	21
7865	The Runaway Pea	2	Oh no!	22
7866	The Runaway Pea	7	The pea fell in, unable to stop.	23
7867	The Runaway Pea	9	then the toaster pinged up with an almighty POP!	24
7868	The Runaway Pea	17	“Owwww,” cried the pea, “my bottom’s on fire,” As he flew straight on into the tumbling dryer.	25
7869	The Runaway Pea	17	Buffered and battered and bounced all about, the pea was so glad when he finally got out.	26
7870	The Runaway Pea	21	He collapsed on a shirt that had newly been washed ... LOOK OUT, little pea, or you're going to get squashed!	27
7871	The Runaway Pea	17	He tumbled and rolled along out of control… ... under the fridge to a dark, sticky hole.	28
7872	The Runaway Pea	11	Too weary to move, he just let out a groan ...	29
7873	The Runaway Pea	8	then got a strange feeling he wasn't alone!	30
7874	The Runaway Pea	15	Out of the gloom came mysterious shapes – a dried-up banana and two mouldy grapes.	31
7875	The Runaway Pea	5	“Oh dear,” said the pea.	32
7876	The Runaway Pea	4	“What happened to you?”	33
7877	The Runaway Pea	5	“We were naughty,” they said.	34
7878	The Runaway Pea	5	“We all ran away too.	35
7879	The Runaway Pea	8	We don’t recommend it,” they whimpered quite sadly.	36
7880	The Runaway Pea	10	“You’ll get old and wrinkled and start to smell badly.”	37
7881	The Runaway Pea	8	“I’ve changed, my mind,” said the runaway pea.	38
7882	The Runaway Pea	11	“I’ll get back on that plate and be ready for tea.”	39
7883	The Runaway Pea	11	"""You won't,” said the grapes, ""cos you've been on the floor."	40
7884	The Runaway Pea	6	Runaway pea, you're not loved anymore.”	41
7885	The Runaway Pea	4	The little pea trembled.	42
7886	The Runaway Pea	5	He knew it was true.	43
7887	The Runaway Pea	10	There was nowhere to go for him, nothing to do.	44
7888	The Runaway Pea	16	Helpless and hopeless and feeling forlorn, his tired eyes closed and he gave a big yawn.	45
7889	The Runaway Pea	10	But a magic thing happened while he was asleep… ...	46
7890	The Runaway Pea	7	he woke up beside the recycling heap.	47
7891	The Runaway Pea	19	The soil was soft and the weather was sunny, and soon the pea started to feel a bit funny.	48
7892	The Runaway Pea	18	Under the ground he was sprouting some roots, and out of his top he was shooting out shoots!	49
7893	The Runaway Pea	19	The shoots all had pods, and inside every one was a party of new peas, all bursting with fun!	50
7894	The Runaway Pea	38	So if you should ever hear POP, PING or SPLAT, or a SPLOSH in the sink, or a YOW from the cat, or a RAPPERTY TAP in the cupboard, then please... Don’t Panic, it’s only those runaway peas!	51
7895	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	11	Once upon a time, there was a little girl called... GOLDILOCKS!	0
7896	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	8	She liked to do something naughty each day.	1

7901	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	9	"Goldilocks' mother always said, ""Don't go into the forest."	6
7902	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	6	"It's full of big, scary bears."""	7
7903	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	4	But Goldilocks wasn't scared-	8
7904	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	8	So on Friday, she went into the forest.	9
7905	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	1	"""Ha!"""	10
7906	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	7	"she said- ""I can't see any bears.”"	11
7907	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	10	She skipped happily along the path until she saw... ...	12
7908	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	4	a pretty little cottage.	13
7909	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	10	"""I wonder who lives here?"" thought Goldilocks, and went inside."	14
7910	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	3	"""Mmm..."" she said."	15
7911	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	10	On the table were three delicious -smelling bowls of porridge.	16
7912	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	14	"“I’m sure no one would mind if I had a tiny taste,"" thought Goldilocks."	17
7913	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	7	First, Goldilocks tried the great, big bowl.	18
7914	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	1	“Yuck!	19
7915	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	2	Too cold!”	20
7916	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	6	Next, she tried the middle-sized bowl.	21
7917	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	1	“OW!	22
7918	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	2	Too hot!”	23
7919	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	8	Last of all, Goldilocks tried the tiny bowl.	24
7920	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	2	"""Yum! Yum!"""	25
7921	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	4	"she said- ""Just right!"""	26
7922	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	6	And she ate it ALL up.	27
7923	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	8	Feeling full, Goldilocks looked for somewhere to sit.	28
7924	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	7	First, she tried the great, big chair.	29
7925	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	2	“Too hard!”	30
7926	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	6	Next, she tried the middle-sized chair.	31
7927	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	2	“Too soft!”	32
7928	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	8	Last of all, she tried the tiny chair.	33
7929	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	3	"""Aha!"" thought Goldilocks."	34
7930	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	2	"""Just right."""	35
7931	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	2	Until... CRACK!	36
7932	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	3	The chair broke.	37
7933	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	3	"""Oops!"" said Goldilocks."	38
7934	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	4	"“Time for a nap."""	39
7935	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	7	Upstairs, she found a great, big bed.	40
7936	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	2	“Too hard!”	41
7937	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	6	Next, she tried the middle-sized bed.	42
7938	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	2	“Too soft!”	43
7939	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	8	Last of all, she tried the tiny bed.	44
7940	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	6	"""Just right,"" said Goldilocks, snuggling down."	45
7941	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	11	As she slept, a large paw pulled open the front door.	46
7942	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	6	Three bears plodded into the house.	47
7943	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	17	There was... a great big father bear, a middle-sized mother bear and a tiny little baby bear.	48
7944	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	5	Who's been eating my porridge?	49
7945	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	3	growled Father Bear.	50
7946	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	5	“Who's been eating my porridge?	51
7947	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	3	"""gasped Mother Bear."	52
7948	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	8	"""Who's been eating my porridge?"" squeaked Baby Bear."	53
7949	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	5	“They’ve eaten it all up!”	54
7950	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	6	Father Bear looked around the room.	55
7951	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	8	"""Who's been sitting in my chair?"" he growled."	56
7952	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	1	"""Well!"	57
7953	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	6	"Who's been sitting in my chair?"""	58
7954	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	3	howled Mother Bear.	59
7955	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	12	"""Who's been sitting in my chair?"" squeaked Baby Bear “They've broken it!"""	60
7956	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	9	They heard a rumbling (snore) coming from the bedroom.	61
7957	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	6	The three bears climbed the stairs.	62
7958	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	9	"“Who's been sleeping in my bed?"" growled Father Bear."	63
7959	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	9	“Who's been sleeping in my bed?” wailed Mother Bear.	64
7960	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	9	"""Who's been sleeping in my bed?"" squeaked Baby Bear."	65
7961	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	3	"""She's still there!"""	66
7962	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	5	Goldilocks woke up and SCREAMED!	67
7963	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	13	She flew out of the cottage and ran all the way home, crying...	68
7964	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	6	"""I'll NEVER, EVER be naughty again."""	69
7965	Goldilocks and the Three Bears	9	Nor did Goldilocks EVER go into the forest again.	70
7966	Zog and the Flying Doctors	10	Meet the Flying Doctors - a dragon, knight and girl.	0
7967	Zog and the Flying Doctors	11	Their names are Gadabout the Great, and Zog, and Princess Pearl.	1
7968	Zog and the Flying Doctors	15	Pearl gives people medicine and And Gadabout is expert at pills and vaccinations, performing operations.	2
7969	Zog and the Flying Doctors	20	Zog is good at flying, though, not quite so good at landing, But Gadabout and Princess Pearl are always understanding.	3
7970	Zog and the Flying Doctors	9	Flying high one morning they heard a mermaid wail.	4
7971	Zog and the Flying Doctors	5	“I’m sunburnt and it hurts!”	5
7972	Zog and the Flying Doctors	7	she cried, and swished her scaly tail.	6
7973	Zog and the Flying Doctors	4	Bang-crash-thump they landed .	7
7974	Zog and the Flying Doctors	5	The mermaid’s skin was red.	8
7975	Zog and the Flying Doctors	7	Pearl rubbed in some special c ream.	9
7976	Zog and the Flying Doctors	6	“And wear this hat,” she said.	10
7977	Zog and the Flying Doctors	22	“Thank you!” said the mermaid, and she waved a fond goodbye As the team of flying doctors sped away into the sky.	11
7978	Zog and the Flying Doctors	9	As the sun rose higher they saw a unicorn.	12
7979	Zog and the Flying Doctors	11	He pawed the ground and whinnied, “I’ve grown an extra horn!”	13
7980	Zog and the Flying Doctors	3	Bang-crash-thump they landed.	14
7981	Zog and the Flying Doctors	7	‘I’ll help you out,’ said the knight.	15
7982	Zog and the Flying Doctors	11	And he cut the horn off gently to the unicorn’s delight.	16
7983	Zog and the Flying Doctors	21	‘Thank you,’ said the unicorn, ‘for taking so much care,’ And the team of flying doctors sped away into the air.	17
7984	Zog and the Flying Doctors	4	Halfway through the afternoon.	18
7985	Zog and the Flying Doctors	5	they heard a lion sneeze.	19
7986	Zog and the Flying Doctors	7	“I’ve caught the flu,” the Lion roared.	20
7987	Zog and the Flying Doctors	5	“Can someone help me, please?	21
7988	Zog and the Flying Doctors	9	Bang-crash-thump they landed, and Pearl said, “Take this pill.	22
7989	Zog and the Flying Doctors	4	And do keep warm!	23
7990	Zog and the Flying Doctors	6	That’s terribly important when you’re ill.’	24
7991	Zog and the Flying Doctors	12	"But the Eon’s cave was chilly, so Zog said, ""Fetch some wood.”"	25
7992	Zog and the Flying Doctors	14	Then he breathed out lots o£ flames until the fire burned bright and good.	26
7993	Zog and the Flying Doctors	5	“Thank you,” roared the lion.	27
7994	Zog and the Flying Doctors	5	“I’m feeling nice and warm.”	28
7995	Zog and the Flying Doctors	11	Then the team of flying doctors sped away into the storm.	29
7996	Zog and the Flying Doctors	11	As evening fell, they saw a great big palace down below.	30
7997	Zog and the Flying Doctors	6	“My uncle’s house!” said Princess Pearl.	31
7998	Zog and the Flying Doctors	5	“Let’s go and say hello.”	32
7999	Zog and the Flying Doctors	3	Bang-crash-thump they landed.	33
8000	Zog and the Flying Doctors	5	Pearl’s uncle was the king.	34
8001	Zog and the Flying Doctors	4	He didn’t say hello.	35
8002	Zog and the Flying Doctors	6	Instead he said, “You naughty thing!	36
8003	Zog and the Flying Doctors	4	‘Where have you been?’	37
8004	Zog and the Flying Doctors	7	he thundered, ‘You look an awful mess.	38
8005	Zog and the Flying Doctors	5	What’s happened to your crown?	39
8006	Zog and the Flying Doctors	6	And where’s your pretty, frilly dress?’	40
8007	Zog and the Flying Doctors	12	“But, Uncle, can’t you see that I’m a doctor now?” said Pearl.	41
8008	Zog and the Flying Doctors	9	"The king replied, ""Princesses can’t be doctors, silly girl!”"	42
8009	Zog and the Flying Doctors	13	He told his men to seize her and to lock her up inside.	43
8010	Zog and the Flying Doctors	4	Princess Pearl was furious.	44
8011	Zog and the Flying Doctors	6	She stamped and stormed and cried.	45
8012	Zog and the Flying Doctors	17	Weeks went by, and Princess Pearl spent many weary hours Sewing pretty cushions and arranging pretty flowers.	46
8013	Zog and the Flying Doctors	24	The others tried to rescue her with all their might and main, But they simply couldn’t manage - all their efforts were in vain.	47
8014	Zog and the Flying Doctors	25	Each night they flew to visit her and perched upon her sill, And one dark night she told them that the king had fallen ill.	48
8015	Zog and the Flying Doctors	14	The king grew worse: his head was sore, his arms and legs felt weak.	49
8016	Zog and the Flying Doctors	6	His skin had turned bright orange	50
8017	Zog and the Flying Doctors	7	and he found it hard to speak.	51
8018	Zog and the Flying Doctors	12	He called a lot of doctors - a new one every day.	52
8019	Zog and the Flying Doctors	6	He croaked, “What is this illness?”	53
8020	Zog and the Flying Doctors	5	but they simply couldn’t say.	54
8021	Zog and the Flying Doctors	10	They didn’t know the answer, but Pearl was pretty sure.	55
8022	Zog and the Flying Doctors	31	“It looks like orange fever,” and she read about the cure: Grated horn of unicorn, a mighty lion’s sneeze, Some mermaid’s scales, a little slime, and half a pound of cheese.”	56
8023	Zog and the Flying Doctors	7	She told the others what to get.	57
8024	Zog and the Flying Doctors	5	“And do be very quick!	58
8025	Zog and the Flying Doctors	10	My uncle could be dying - he looks extremely sick.”	59
8026	Zog and the Flying Doctors	5	Away flew Zog and Gadabout.	60
8027	Zog and the Flying Doctors	5	They reached the lion’s den.	61
8028	Zog and the Flying Doctors	3	Bang-crash-thump they landed.	62
8029	Zog and the Flying Doctors	8	He sneezed for them, and then .. .	63
8030	Zog and the Flying Doctors	20	They flew back to the forest, where the grateful unicorn Was very pleased to give them his unwanted sawn-off horn.	64
8031	Zog and the Flying Doctors	7	Back to the mermaid’s rock they flew.	65
8032	Zog and the Flying Doctors	16	She gladly gave some scales, And her sea-snail friends allowed them to collect their slimy trails.	66
8033	Zog and the Flying Doctors	4	Zog said, “I’m exhausted!”	67
8034	Zog and the Flying Doctors	6	but he flew and flew, until.	68
8035	Zog and the Flying Doctors	7	Bang-crash-thump he landed on the bedroom windowsill.	69
8036	Zog and the Flying Doctors	26	Princess Pearl said thank you for the scales, the slime, the sneeze, And the horn (which then she grated up with half a pound of cheese.)	70
8037	Zog and the Flying Doctors	6	She tiptoed to her uncle’s room.	71
8038	Zog and the Flying Doctors	6	The king lay in his bed.	72
8039	Zog and the Flying Doctors	7	She held a spoonful to his mouth.	73
8040	Zog and the Flying Doctors	5	“Now, open wide,” she said.	74
8041	Zog and the Flying Doctors	18	After just one spoonful her uncle felt much stronger, And after spoonful two he wasn’t orange any longer.	75
8042	Zog and the Flying Doctors	9	After spoonful three, the king was dancing with delight.	76
8043	Zog and the Flying Doctors	9	“Princesses can be doctors - you were absolutely right!	77
8044	Zog and the Flying Doctors	7	I’m sorry that I locked you up.	78
8045	Zog and the Flying Doctors	20	Of course you must go free, But do come back to visit me — and bring your friends to tea.	79
8046	Zog and the Flying Doctors	12	“Hooray!” cried Pearl, and out she ran to join the other two.	80
8047	Zog and the Flying Doctors	10	Then off into the sunset sped the flying doctor crew.	81

8135	Kipper's A to Z	2	Is it?	87
8136	Kipper's A to Z	4	Yy is for yes.	88
8137	Kipper's A to Z	18	So the zebra stood in the middle of the page, and we all said, Zz is for Zebra!	89
8138	Kipper's A to Z	6	And for Arnold’s little zoo, too.	90
8139	Little Red Riding Hood	14	Once upon a time there was a little girl called Little Red Riding Hood.	0
8140	Little Red Riding Hood	12	She always wore a bright red cloak with a bright red hood.	1
8141	Little Red Riding Hood	1	/	2
8142	Little Red Riding Hood	13	She lived with her mother on the edge of some deep, dark woods.	3
8143	Little Red Riding Hood	15	One day, Little Red Riding Hood's mother gave her a pot of Brussels sprout soup.	4
8144	Little Red Riding Hood	14	"""Take this to your grandmother on the other side of the woods,” she said."	5
8145	Little Red Riding Hood	7	"""But remember the Rules of the Woods!”"	6
8146	Little Red Riding Hood	11	"""I promise,” said Little Red Riding Wood, and off she went..."	7
8147	Little Red Riding Hood	10	"""Oh what a lovely day!” said Little Red Riding Wood."	8
8148	Little Red Riding Hood	9	"""Good morning, Little Red Riding Hood,” called the woodcutter."	9
8149	Little Red Riding Hood	8	"""Good morning, Woodcutter,” called Little Red Riding Hood."	10
8150	Little Red Riding Hood	13	Little Red Riding Hood walked deeper and deeper into the deep, dark woods.	11
8151	Little Red Riding Hood	5	It grew darker and darker.	12
8152	Little Red Riding Hood	15	So Little Red Riding Hood didn't see the wolf waiting for her on the path.	13
8153	Little Red Riding Hood	10	And the wolf didn't see Little Red Riding Hood either.	14
8154	Little Red Riding Hood	9	Little Red Riding Hood stumbled straight into the wolf.	15
8155	Little Red Riding Hood	15	"""What are you doing in the middle of the path?” asked Little Red Riding Hood."	16
8156	Little Red Riding Hood	8	"""I nearly spilled my grandmother's Brussels sprout soup.”"	17
8157	Little Red Riding Hood	1	“Sprouts!	18
8158	Little Red Riding Hood	1	Yuk!”	19
8159	Little Red Riding Hood	3	Said the wolf.	20
8160	Little Red Riding Hood	6	“Wolves only eat JUICY RED MEAT!”	21
8161	Little Red Riding Hood	13	Little Red Riding Hood had forgotten the rule - Don't talk to wolves.	22
8162	Little Red Riding Hood	27	The wolf was just about to gobble up Little Red Riding Hood, when he had a BRILLIANT idea: ‘I’ll eat Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother!’	23
8163	Little Red Riding Hood	3	Thought the wolf.	24
8164	Little Red Riding Hood	10	"""And where does dear little Granny live?” asked the wolf."	25
8165	Little Red Riding Hood	15	"""In the cottage on the other side of the woods,” said Little Red Riding Hood."	26
8166	Little Red Riding Hood	12	Th The wolf raced to the cottage and knocked on the door.	27
8167	Little Red Riding Hood	4	“Come in,” called grandmother.	28
8168	Little Red Riding Hood	18	The wolf leaped into the room... ...and gobbled up Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother in two seconds flat.	29
8169	Little Red Riding Hood	1	“Mmm!	30
8170	Little Red Riding Hood	4	Bony but not bad!”	31
8171	Little Red Riding Hood	17	Then he pulled on her cap, jumped into bed - and waited for Little Red Riding Hood.	32
8172	Little Red Riding Hood	8	Soon, there was a knock at the door.	33
8173	Little Red Riding Hood	10	"""Come In,"" snarled the wolf, as softly as he could."	34
8174	Little Red Riding Hood	11	Little Red Riding Hood looked at her grandmother... ...then looked again.	35
8175	Little Red Riding Hood	8	“Granny,” she said, “What big ears you have.	36
8176	Little Red Riding Hood	2	you have.”	37
8177	Little Red Riding Hood	7	“All the better to hear you with.”	38
8178	Little Red Riding Hood	2	“Oh Granny!	39
8179	Little Red Riding Hood	4	big eyes you have.”	40
8180	Little Red Riding Hood	14	“All the better to see you with” “Oh Granny, what big teeth you have.”	41
8181	Little Red Riding Hood	7	“All the better to eat you with!”	42
8182	Little Red Riding Hood	16	In one bound, the wolf was out of bed and gobbling up Little Red Riding Wood.	43
8183	Little Red Riding Hood	1	"""Dee-lielous!”"	44
8184	Little Red Riding Hood	6	he said... ...then fell fast asleep.	45
8185	Little Red Riding Hood	7	As he slept, he snored -very loudly.	46
8186	Little Red Riding Hood	6	"""What's going on?” wondered the woodcutter."	47
8187	Little Red Riding Hood	9	"""He’s eaten that poor old woman!” realized the woodcutter."	48
8188	Little Red Riding Hood	5	He picked up some scissors.	49
8189	Little Red Riding Hood	6	He snipped open the wolf’s tummy.	50
8190	Little Red Riding Hood	9	Out popped grandmother, and Little Red Riding Hood, too.	51
8191	Little Red Riding Hood	19	Quick as a flash, Little Red Riding Hood picked up some stones and piled them into the wolf's tummy.	52
8192	Little Red Riding Hood	12	When the wolf woke up, he tried to sneak out the door.	53
8193	Little Red Riding Hood	10	But the stones rattled and rattled and rattled inside him.	54
8194	Little Red Riding Hood	6	"""Now everyone can hear me coming."	55
8195	Little Red Riding Hood	8	I’ll never catch anyone,” cried the wolf. ''	56
8196	Little Red Riding Hood	4	"Exactly!"" said the woodcutter."	57
8197	Little Red Riding Hood	12	"""You’ll just have to eat vegetables instead,” said Little Red Riding Hood."	58
8198	Little Red Riding Hood	9	The wolf was never able to eat another person.	59
8199	Little Red Riding Hood	4	“Urgh! Brussels sprout soup.”	60
8200	Little Red Riding Hood	14	As for Little Red Riding Hood, she never, ever talked to a wolf again.	61
8201	The Three Little Pigs	13	Once upon a time lived a mother pig, with her three little pigs.	0
8202	The Three Little Pigs	27	They lived happily together, but the mother pig was very poor, so she decided to send the three little pigs into the world to seek their fortunes.	1
8203	The Three Little Pigs	6	They set off in the sunshine.	2
8204	The Three Little Pigs	11	Each carried his few treasures and some turnip tops for lunch.	3
8205	The Three Little Pigs	16	After a while, they reached a crossroads, and each little pig went down a different path.	4
8206	The Three Little Pigs	13	The first little pig met a man carrying a large bundle of straw.	5
8207	The Three Little Pigs	17	“Excuse me,” he said, “would you give me some straw so that I may build a house?”	6
8208	The Three Little Pigs	4	“Certainly,” said the man.	7
8209	The Three Little Pigs	4	“It’s making me sneeze...”	8
8210	The Three Little Pigs	16	The happy little pig built his house of straw, and settled down to his new life.	9
8211	The Three Little Pigs	8	Soon there was a knock at the door.	10
8212	The Three Little Pigs	6	“Who’s there?” asked the little pig.	11
8213	The Three Little Pigs	2	“It’s me...	12
8214	The Three Little Pigs	13	your friend... the wolf... Won’t you let me in?” said a growly voice.	13
8215	The Three Little Pigs	5	“NO,” said the little pig.	14
8216	The Three Little Pigs	7	“Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin!”	15
8217	The Three Little Pigs	16	So the wolf said, “Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll BLOW your house down.”	16
8218	The Three Little Pigs	12	And he huffed and he puffed, and down fell the straw house.	17
8219	The Three Little Pigs	11	The poor little pig ran off as fast as he could.	18
8220	The Three Little Pigs	15	The second little pig had met a man who was carrying a bundle of sticks.	19
8221	The Three Little Pigs	17	“Excuse me,” he asked, “would you give me those sticks so I may build myself a house?”	20
8222	The Three Little Pigs	5	“Of course,” replied the man.	21
8223	The Three Little Pigs	11	“I’ve forgotten why I was carrying them in the first place.”	22
8224	The Three Little Pigs	9	So the second little pig built himself a house.	23
8225	The Three Little Pigs	9	But soon there was a tap on the door.	24
8226	The Three Little Pigs	3	“Who is it?”	25
8227	The Three Little Pigs	5	the little pig asked nervously.	26
8228	The Three Little Pigs	2	“It’s me.	27
8229	The Three Little Pigs	6	Your brother,” said a worried voice.	28
8230	The Three Little Pigs	4	“Do let me in!”	29
8231	The Three Little Pigs	12	The second little pig opened the door, and in fell his brother.	30
8232	The Three Little Pigs	21	He was out of breath, and just as he was about to speak, there came a loud knock at the door.	31
8233	The Three Little Pigs	6	“Who’s there?” asked the little pigs.	32
8234	The Three Little Pigs	6	“It’s me,” growled a sly voice.	33
8235	The Three Little Pigs	7	“Open the door and let me in.”	34
8236	The Three Little Pigs	6	“Never!” cried the two little pigs.	35
8237	The Three Little Pigs	12	“Not by the hairs on our chinny-chin-chins, you shall never come in!”	36
8238	The Three Little Pigs	16	So the wolf said, “Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll BLOW your house down.”	37
8239	The Three Little Pigs	13	So he huffed and he puffed, and the house of sticks blew apart.	38
8240	The Three Little Pigs	11	The two little pigs ran off as fast as they could.	39
8241	The Three Little Pigs	12	The third little pig had done exactly the same as his brothers.	40
8242	The Three Little Pigs	25	He had walked happily along the road and soon met a man who was pulling a cart laden with heavy bricks and bags of cement.	41
8243	The Three Little Pigs	14	“Excuse me,” he asked, “but might you spare me those bricks and some cement?	42
8244	The Three Little Pigs	12	They are just what I need to build a safe little house.”	43
8245	The Three Little Pigs	7	“I’d be glad to,” said the man.	44
8246	The Three Little Pigs	6	“Pulling this load is hard work.”	45
8247	The Three Little Pigs	17	So the third little pig built his house: It had four square walls, and a fine chimney.	46
8248	The Three Little Pigs	14	He had just settled down inside, when there came a tap at his door.	47
8249	The Three Little Pigs	2	“Who’s there?”	48
8250	The Three Little Pigs	2	he asked.	49
8251	The Three Little Pigs	2	“It’s us.	50
8252	The Three Little Pigs	2	Your brothers.	51
8253	The Three Little Pigs	4	Please let us in.”	52
8254	The Three Little Pigs	10	The little pig opened his door, and in they tumbled.	53
8255	The Three Little Pigs	6	They were very out of breath.	54
8256	The Three Little Pigs	15	They had just started to speak when there came a loud knock on the door.	55
8257	The Three Little Pigs	6	“Who’s there?” said the little pigs.	56
8258	The Three Little Pigs	6	“It’s me,” said a gruff voice.	57
8259	The Three Little Pigs	7	“Open the door and let me in!”	58
8260	The Three Little Pigs	5	“Never!” cried the little pigs.	59
8261	The Three Little Pigs	12	“Not by every hair on our chinny-chin-chins, you shall never come in.”	60
8262	The Three Little Pigs	16	So the wolf said, “Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll BLOW your house down...	61
8263	The Three Little Pigs	11	and then I shall come in and eat you all up!”	62
8264	The Three Little Pigs	6	The wolf drew in his breath.	63
8265	The Three Little Pigs	5	He huffed, and he puffed.	64
8266	The Three Little Pigs	11	He puffed, and he huffed, until he could blow no more.	65
8267	The Three Little Pigs	6	But the little house stood firm.	66
8268	The Three Little Pigs	5	The wolf was worn out.	67
8269	The Three Little Pigs	5	He was hungry and cross.	68
8270	The Three Little Pigs	8	“I shall find another way in,” he snarled.	69
8271	The Three Little Pigs	8	He began to climb on to the roof.	70
8272	The Three Little Pigs	12	“He’s going to come down the chimney,” said the first little pig.	71
8273	The Three Little Pigs	9	“What shall we do?” said the second little pig.	72
8274	The Three Little Pigs	7	“I know,” said the third little pig.	73
8275	The Three Little Pigs	5	“We must build a fire.”	74
8276	The Three Little Pigs	10	They set to, and soon had a good fire blazing.	75
8277	The Three Little Pigs	7	The wolf lowered himself down the chimney.	76
8278	The Three Little Pigs	15	As his bottom inched downwards, so the flames inched upwards ... until suddenly... “ !”	77
8279	The Three Little Pigs	19	YOWL The wolf’s bottom and tail were scorched and he shot out of the chimney sparking like a rocket.	78
8280	The Three Little Pigs	11	The three little pigs were never troubled by the wolf again.	79
8281	The Three Little Pigs	8	They lived happily in the little brick house.	80
8282	The Three Little Pigs	18	Soon they sent for their mother, and they all lived happily together for as long as they could.	81
8283	The Three Little Pigs	6	Which was a very long time.	82
8284	Lenny Makes A Wish	12	The blossom’s out, the birds are singing, spring at last has come.	0
8285	Lenny Makes A Wish	9	Lenny’s in the meadow, picking flowers for his mum.	1
8286	Lenny Makes A Wish	23	He takes a rest beside a pool, beneath a shady tree, and spies a funny little fish as black as black can be.	2
8287	Lenny Makes A Wish	9	Seeing that she’s all alone makes Lenny very sad.	3
8288	Lenny Makes A Wish	11	He very gently asks her, “Where’s your mummy or your dad?”	4
8289	Lenny Makes A Wish	12	“I used to live quite far from here, with all my family.	5
8290	Lenny Makes A Wish	12	But then a storm swept us apart and now it’s only me.”	6
8291	Lenny Makes A Wish	5	Lenny wonders what to do.	7
8292	Lenny Makes A Wish	5	How lonely she must be!	8
8293	Lenny Makes A Wish	20	But soon he has a great idea and hopes that she’ll agree ... “Do you want to be my friend?	9
8294	Lenny Makes A Wish	4	I’m sometimes lonely too.”	10
8295	Lenny Makes A Wish	11	The fishy nods her head and squeaks, “I really, really do!”	11
8296	Lenny Makes A Wish	10	So Lenny kneels beside the pool and fishes Fishy out.	12
8297	Lenny Makes A Wish	11	But suddenly she starts to gasp and flip and flap about!	13
8298	Lenny Makes A Wish	6	“Oh no,” cries Lenny, “I forgot!	14
8299	Lenny Makes A Wish	5	You cannot breathe in air!”	15
8300	Lenny Makes A Wish	12	He throws her back and, luckily she’s none the worse for wear.	16
8301	Lenny Makes A Wish	12	“Let’s play in my pool,” Fishy says, so Lenny jumps right in.	17
8302	Lenny Makes A Wish	13	But straight away it’s clear to him ... that rabbits do not swim!	18
8303	Lenny Makes A Wish	10	Seconds later Mum appears, her eyes are wide with fear.	19
8304	Lenny Makes A Wish	5	“Never play near water, Lenny!	20
8305	Lenny Makes A Wish	1	NEVER!	21
8306	Lenny Makes A Wish	3	Do you hear?”	22
8307	Lenny Makes A Wish	6	So Lenny says a sad goodbye	23
8308	Lenny Makes A Wish	5	His eyes are getting wet.	24
8309	Lenny Makes A Wish	23	He gives the fish his scarf, and whispers, ‘So you don’t forget” Days go by and Fishy tries but cannot smile at all.	25
8310	Lenny Makes A Wish	5	She cuddles Lenny’s precious scarf.	26
8311	Lenny Makes A Wish	6	And tears begin to fall .	27
8312	Lenny Makes A Wish	20	Lenny’s missing Fishy too and often, late at night, he looks into the endless dark and hopes that she’s alright.	28
8313	Lenny Makes A Wish	15	But then there comes a night SO clear – the stars are bright as gems!	29
8314	Lenny Makes A Wish	11	He wishes on the biggest one, “Please let us meet again!”	30
8315	Lenny Makes A Wish	10	Eventually, the summer comes, the days are long and hot.	31
8316	Lenny Makes A Wish	11	Mum and Len are having lunch, when suddenly they spot... ...	32
8317	Lenny Makes A Wish	10	a very smiley little frog who’s hopping up the path.	33
8318	Lenny Makes A Wish	11	They take a closer look and see she’s wearing Lenny’s scarf!	34
8319	Lenny Makes A Wish	7	“I was a tadpole, not a fish!”	35
8320	Lenny Makes A Wish	19	the froggy laughs, and then she shyly turns to Len and says, “Do you want to be my friend?”	36
8321	Lenny Makes A Wish	5	Lenny’s happy as can be.	37
8322	Lenny Makes A Wish	5	He can’t believe it’s true!	38
8323	Lenny Makes A Wish	11	He answers with a great big grin… “I really, really do!”	39
8324	The Christmas Story	17	Long ago, in Nazareth, a mother dove said to her baby, “A very special time has come.	0
8325	The Christmas Story	11	Fly with me, little one, and I will show you why.”	1
8326	The Christmas Story	11	The mother dove flew with her baby, over quiet, sleepy Nazareth.	2
8327	The Christmas Story	13	Suddenly, a dazzling light shone out from the windows of a little house.	3
8328	The Christmas Story	8	Inside the house, the angel Gabriel had appeared.	4
8329	The Christmas Story	7	He spoke to a girl called Mary.	5
8330	The Christmas Story	9	“You will have a special baby boy,” he said.	6
8331	The Christmas Story	12	“He is the son of God and you will call him Jesus.”	7
8332	The Christmas Story	14	Over many months, the little dove came to see Mary and her husband, Joseph.	8
8333	The Christmas Story	13	One day, Joseph said to Mary, “We must make a journey to Bethlehem.”	9
8334	The Christmas Story	14	Mary rode on a donkey and Joseph walked along the dusty path to Bethlehem.	10
8335	The Christmas Story	7	The little dove felt sorry for them.	11
8336	The Christmas Story	7	“They must be very tired,” he thought.	12
8337	The Christmas Story	12	In Bethlehem, the night had come, but all the inns were full.	13
8338	The Christmas Story	14	There was nowhere to rest for Mary and Joseph and everyone turned them away.	14
8339	The Christmas Story	8	The very last innkeeper took pity on them.	15
8340	The Christmas Story	8	“You can stay in my stable,” he said.	16
8341	The Christmas Story	12	So, Mary and Joseph went inside to settle down for the night.	17
8342	The Christmas Story	15	On a hill nearby, shepherds were tending their sheep, when an angel appeared to them.	18
8343	The Christmas Story	6	“Do not be afraid,” he said.	19
8344	The Christmas Story	6	“For Jesus is born this night.”	20
8345	The Christmas Story	10	Far away in the east, three kings saw a star.	21
8346	The Christmas Story	6	“We must follow it,” they said.	22
8347	The Christmas Story	9	“The star is a sign that Jesus is born.	23
8348	The Christmas Story	7	We will go to him this night.”	24
8349	Knock Knock Alien	2	KNOCK KNOCK!	0
8350	Knock Knock Alien	4	Who’s at the door?	1
8351	Knock Knock Alien	12	One thing I’ve never seen before… It gazes at a distant star.	2
8352	Knock Knock Alien	3	"I say, “Hi!"""	3
8353	Knock Knock Alien	4	and it says, “BOOO-BAA!”	4
8354	Knock Knock Alien	4	"“Are you an ALIEN?"""	5
8355	Knock Knock Alien	2	I say.	6
8356	Knock Knock Alien	6	“From far across the Milky Way?	7
8357	Knock Knock Alien	3	Are you lonely?	8
8358	Knock Knock Alien	3	Are you lost?	9
8359	Knock Knock Alien	6	"How many galaxies have you crossed?"""	10
8360	Knock Knock Alien	6	The creature points at Granny’s chair.	11
8361	Knock Knock Alien	1	Yikes!	12
8362	Knock Knock Alien	6	TWO blue Bargles sit right there!	13
8363	Knock Knock Alien	2	"“Oh no!"""	14
8364	Knock Knock Alien	2	I gasp.	15
8365	Knock Knock Alien	4	“Don’t wake my gran.	16
8366	Knock Knock Alien	2	Get down!	17
8367	Knock Knock Alien	5	Be quiet as you can!”	18
8368	Knock Knock Alien	13	Next, THREE pink Pogs with stripy lips bounce through the doorway, doing flips.	19
8369	Knock Knock Alien	14	Then FOUR red Rarks with hairy ears all beam inside to whoops and cheers.	20
8370	Knock Knock Alien	7	"“We must get home,"" the Bargles say."	21
8371	Knock Knock Alien	1	“Quick!	22
8372	Knock Knock Alien	5	Start the countdown, right away!”	23
8373	Knock Knock Alien	2	“Hey, wait!”	24
8374	Knock Knock Alien	2	I call.	25
8375	Knock Knock Alien	3	“What's going on?	26
8376	Knock Knock Alien	2	What countdown?	27
8377	Knock Knock Alien	1	Stop.	28
8378	Knock Knock Alien	4	You’ve got it wrong!”	29
8379	Knock Knock Alien	13	FIVE green Croobs on a sonic broom grab gadgets from around the room.	30
8380	Knock Knock Alien	7	They press a button, red and round.	31
8381	Knock Knock Alien	6	I hear a dreadful wrenching sound.	32
8382	Knock Knock Alien	4	“At last!” they cry.	33
8383	Knock Knock Alien	4	“Let’s leave this place!”	34
8384	Knock Knock Alien	2	Then… BOOM!	35
8385	Knock Knock Alien	6	Our house blasts into space! ’	36
8386	Knock Knock Alien	7	u The thrusters ROAR, then fizzle out.	37
8387	Knock Knock Alien	7	Then WOOOAH things start to float about!	38
8388	Knock Knock Alien	5	Hey, everybody, look at me!’	39
8389	Knock Knock Alien	5	It's fun in zero gravity!”	40
8390	Knock Knock Alien	8	We zoom off at the speed of light.	41
8391	Knock Knock Alien	8	But SIX black Buffs hark, “That’s not right!	42
8392	Knock Knock Alien	7	We want to go to Planet Boot.	43
8393	Knock Knock Alien	7	We’ll have to take a faster route.”	44
8394	Knock Knock Alien	14	They grab at the remote control and steer us through a big black hole!	45
8395	Knock Knock Alien	15	The black hole twists us inside out then snaps us back and… …spits us out.	46
8396	Knock Knock Alien	7	We veer off in a deadly spin.	47
8397	Knock Knock Alien	1	Yikes!	48
8398	Knock Knock Alien	6	Seven white wiggles get sucked in!	49
8399	Knock Knock Alien	1	“Help!	50
8400	Knock Knock Alien	1	Help!”	51
8401	Knock Knock Alien	2	I cry.	52
8402	Knock Knock Alien	1	“Reverse!	53
8403	Knock Knock Alien	1	Reverse!”	54
8404	Knock Knock Alien	8	But that just seems to make things worse.	55
8405	Knock Knock Alien	13	We back into a murky moon… ... and crash-land in the swampy gloom.	56
8406	Knock Knock Alien	2	“Oh dear!”	57
8407	Knock Knock Alien	2	I groan.	58
8408	Knock Knock Alien	4	“What shall we do?”	59

8446	Boogie Bear	14	The biggest, furriest one of all was sunning herself on an iceberg as usual.	1
8447	Boogie Bear	23	Lying there without a care in the world, she scooped fish from the sea with her paw and dropped them into her mouth.	2
8448	Boogie Bear	12	“This is the life,” she sighed as she drifted off to sleep.	3
8449	Boogie Bear	28	“Zzzz zzzz zzzz zzzz zzzz zzzz zzzz zzzz zzzz zzzz zzzz zzzz zzzz zzzz zzzz” woke up, the most awful thing had When the polar bear finally happened.	4
8450	Boogie Bear	26	The animal must have eaten too much for lunch again because the part of the iceberg she was lying on had snapped off, and floated away.	5
8451	Boogie Bear	16	The polar bear was now miles from home and being hurled around by the angry sea.	6
8452	Boogie Bear	13	“Oh dear oh dear,” she said as she wobbled, surfing a humongous wave.	7
8453	Boogie Bear	6	Surely things couldn’t get any worse.	8
8454	Boogie Bear	2	They could.	9
8455	Boogie Bear	2	Much worse.	10
8456	Boogie Bear	21	As the polar bear was swept south, the sea became warmer warmer, and melting the iceberg, which became smaller and smaller.	11
8457	Boogie Bear	3	Free Geography Lesson.	12
8458	Boogie Bear	9	Soon it was no bigger than an ice Cube.	13
8459	Boogie Bear	4	“Oh dear, oh dear,	14
8460	Boogie Bear	13	oh dear” said the polar bear as she toppled over into the sea.	15
8461	Boogie Bear	1	Splosh!	16
8462	Boogie Bear	19	Bobbing her head up out of the water, the polar bear spied that the nearest land was miles away.	17
8463	Boogie Bear	2	“Oh dear	18
8464	Boogie Bear	2	oh dear	19
8465	Boogie Bear	2	oh dear,	20
8466	Boogie Bear	2	oh dear!”	21
8467	Boogie Bear	17	She did her best bear paddle® towards it, before collapsing on the rocks, waves crashing around her.	22
8468	Boogie Bear	8	© Bear like doggy paddle but more beary.	23
8469	Boogie Bear	9	Behind her she heard a rustling in the forest.	24
8470	Boogie Bear	1	Rustle!	25
8471	Boogie Bear	1	Rustle!	26
8472	Boogie Bear	1	Rustle!	27
8473	Boogie Bear	12	The only thing more rustley would be someone called Russell Russell watching.	28
8474	Boogie Bear	17	Looking up, the polar bear saw hundreds of eyes staring back at her but of the gloom.	29
8475	Boogie Bear	4	“Oh dear, oh dear,	30
8476	Boogie Bear	2	oh dear,	31
8477	Boogie Bear	2	oh dear,	32
8478	Boogie Bear	3	oh very dear!”	33
8479	Boogie Bear	4	she whispered to herself.	34
8480	Boogie Bear	6	Surely things couldn’t get any worse.	35
8481	Boogie Bear	2	They could.	36
8482	Boogie Bear	2	Much worse.	37
8483	Boogie Bear	4	“Charge!” came a voice.	38
8484	Boogie Bear	15	Before the polar bear knew it, a hundred brown, furry creatures were stampeding towards her.	39
8485	Boogie Bear	1	“Argh!”	40
8486	Boogie Bear	7	hey cried, like soldiers running into battle.	41
8487	Boogie Bear	11	“Get the BOOGIE MONSTER!” bellowed the littlest one from the back.	42
8488	Boogie Bear	5	“What’s a BOOGIE MONSTER?” ”	43
8489	Boogie Bear	10	That is!” shouted the big one with the floppy ears.	44
8490	Boogie Bear	10	“I’m scared” said the one with the biggest, wettest nose.	45
8491	Boogie Bear	10	The brown bears had never seen a white bear before.	46
8492	Boogie Bear	4	“Oh dear, oh dear,	47
8493	Boogie Bear	2	oh dear,	48
8494	Boogie Bear	22	oh dear, oh very very dear!” said the polar bear, and she ran away into the forest as fast® as she could.	49
8495	Boogie Bear	1	®	50
8496	Boogie Bear	10	It wasn’t actually that fast, but at least she tried.	51
8497	Boogie Bear	15	Brown bears came from all sides, and soon the white bear had nowhere to run.	52
8498	Boogie Bear	20	Ahead of her was the tallest tree in the forest, so she clambered all the way up to the top.	53
8499	Boogie Bear	1	®	54
8500	Boogie Bear	12	It is impossible to clamber all the way up to the bottom.	55
8501	Boogie Bear	17	The tree swayed under her weight The white bear clung on desperately, as the brown bears circled.	56

8506	Boogie Bear	4	she said to herself.	61
8507	Boogie Bear	12	“Get the Boogie Monster!” shouted the small one, baring his sharp teeth.	62
8508	Boogie Bear	5	“Can someone else do it?	63
8509	Boogie Bear	10	It’s scary!” whined the one with the biggest, wettest nose.	64
8510	Boogie Bear	8	“I am not scary!” shouted the polar bear.	65
8511	Boogie Bear	3	“Yes you are.	66
8512	Boogie Bear	4	said the little one.	67
8513	Boogie Bear	6	Your fur is a funny colour!	68
8514	Boogie Bear	9	“Well, I think your fur is a funny colour!”	69
8515	Boogie Bear	3	That enraged him.	70
8516	Boogie Bear	3	“Got UP there!”	71
8517	Boogie Bear	2	he ordered.	72
8518	Boogie Bear	12	Tm scared of heights,” replied the one with the biggest, wettest nose.	73
8519	Boogie Bear	14	The smallest one huffed and picked up a stick as big as he was.	74
8520	Boogie Bear	7	He hurled it at the polar bear.	75
8521	Boogie Bear	5	“Take THAT, BOOGIE MONSTER!” Woosh!	76
8522	Boogie Bear	6	“Ouch!” called out the polar bear.	77
8523	Boogie Bear	14	She lost her grip and slid down the tree at speed… IS ‘Oh dear,	78

8527	Boogie Bear	2	oh dear,	82
8528	Boogie Bear	2	oh dear…”	83
8529	Boogie Bear	35	she muttered to herself, as her big forty bottom hit each branch on the way down... until she hit a big, bendy branch, which bounced her right back up to the top of the tree.	84
8530	Boogie Bear	6	Surely things couldn’t get any worse.	85
8531	Boogie Bear	2	They could.	86
8532	Boogie Bear	2	Much worse.	87
8533	Boogie Bear	13	As the polar bear was so heavy, the tree buckled to one side.	88
8534	Boogie Bear	15	The pack of brown bears reached up with their paws and grabbed at the trunk.	89
8535	Boogie Bear	8	“Get the BOOGIE MONSTER!” ordered the little one.	90
8536	Boogie Bear	15	The brown bears lost their grip on the trunk, and the tree twanged back up.	91
8537	Boogie Bear	9	A twong is like a twang but more twongy.	92
8538	Boogie Bear	12	“Ooooooohhhh dddeeaarrr!” screamed the polar bear as she soared through the air.	93
8539	Boogie Bear	12	“It’s a flying monster!” remarked the one with the biggest, wettest nose.	94
8540	Boogie Bear	7	Now polar bears are not natural fliers.	95
8541	Boogie Bear	26	None have wings or own jet-packs or can pilot helicopters… … If you think you have a polar bear flying a helicopter, please consult a doctor.	96
8542	Boogie Bear	14	In no time the poor animal had crash-landed headfirst into a huge muddy puddle.	97
8543	Boogie Bear	1	Splat!	98
8544	Boogie Bear	9	“Let’s get the BOOGIE MONSTER!” shouted the littlest one.	99

8558	Boogie Bear	17	“Miss, we are so sorry for frightening you,” said the one with the floppy ears, stepping forward.	113
8559	Boogie Bear	5	“In truth, we were frightened.	114
8560	Boogie Bear	8	Here, you see, ail us bears are brown.”	115
8561	Boogie Bear	10	“There all us bears are white,” she said, pointing north.	116
8562	Boogie Bear	17	“I love your white fur,” said the brown bear, checking out the white bear’s big, furry bottom.	117
8563	Boogie Bear	17	“I love your brown fur,” said the white bear, checking out the brown bear’s big, furry bottom.	118
8564	Boogie Bear	8	“Yuckety yuck yuck yuck!” exclaimed the littlest one.	119
8565	Boogie Bear	9	The pair rubbed noses in a show of love.	120
8566	Boogie Bear	24	The birds in the trees tweeted sweet music, butterflies swooped and twirled and, as if that wasn’t enough, a rainbow appeared in the sky.	121
8567	Boogie Bear	15	From that day on, the two lovestruck bears spent all their days and nights together.	122
8568	Boogie Bear	11	The white bear had never eaten honey before, which she loved.	123
8569	Boogie Bear	13	The brown bear had never eaten walrus before, which he pretended to love.	124

8571	Boogie Bear	5	Things couldn’t get any better.	126
8572	Boogie Bear	3	But they could.	127
8573	Boogie Bear	14	Much better… That spring, the polar bear had a litter of beautiful bear cubs.	128

9099	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	7	Stegosaurus said he didn’t want to go..	3
9100	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	10	Not after Triceratops told him about no Raaahs in class.	4
9101	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	9	Mum said not to worry, school would be fine.	5
9102	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	8	Harry blew his whistle just like a teacher.	6
9103	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	8	He said, “In twos, holding hands, my dinosaurs.	7
9104	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	7	No talking and jump in the bucket.”	8
9105	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	6	The dinosaurs did what Harry said.	9
9106	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	3	All except Stegosaurus.	10
9107	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	9	He was so nervous, all his plates were rattling.	11
9108	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	8	Harry had to give him a special stroke.	12
9109	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	17	Sam said, “You can’t take dinosaurs to school, stupid'” That’s why her toast fell on the floor.	13
9110	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	5	Mum took Harry to school.	14
9111	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	14	Mrs Rance was waiting at the classroom door when Harry and Mum got there.	15
9112	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	4	“Hello, Harry,” she said.	16
9113	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	5	“Welcome to your new school.”	17
9114	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	9	They all said goodbye to the mums and dads.	18
9115	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	8	Then Mrs Rance showed Harry the coat pegs.	19
9116	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	9	“You can leave your lunchbox here too,” she said.	20
9117	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	12	Harry was too shy to say could he have his bucket back.	21
9118	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	9	That’s why his dinosaurs got left outside the classroom.	22
9119	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	10	Harry missed his dinosaurs, so he didn’t like the classroom.	23
9120	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	11	He didn’t like the home comer, or his special work tray.	24
9121	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	18	And he felt sorry for another new boy with a digger who cried when his mum went home.	25
9122	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	11	The boy wouldn’t say one single word, not even his name.	26
9123	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	8	Harry sort of liked the playground at playtime.	27
9124	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	14	But it wasn’t much fun, even the monkey bars - not without his dinosaurs.	28
9125	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	9	Back in class, the digger boy still wouldn’t speak.	29
9126	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	10	“Maybe he wants to go to the toilet,” Harry suggested.	30
9127	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	8	“I’ll show him where it is, shall I?”	31
9128	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	7	Mrs Rance said good idea, how thoughtful.	32
9129	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	10	All the way to the toilet the boy kept quiet.	33
9130	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	14	It was the same on the way back, till they got to the coats.	34
9131	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	10	"""Then they heard a voice, very sad and very soft."	35
9132	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	1	“Raaaaaaaaaah!”	36
9133	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	2	it said.	37
9134	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	5	“That’s my dinosaurs,” said Harry.	38
9135	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	3	“They miss me.	39
9136	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	6	Would you like to see them?”	40
9137	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	16	The boy nodded so Harry said, “This is my Apatosaurus and my Anchisaurus and my Scelidosaurus.	41
9138	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	5	This is Triceratops and Tyrannosaurus.	42
9139	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	4	Pterodactyl is the baby.	43
9140	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	1	Wait!	44
9141	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	2	Where’s Stegosaurus?”	45
9142	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	5	“Jump out, Stegosaurus,” called Harry.	46
9143	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	3	“Don’t be shy!”	47
9144	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	5	But Stegosaurus wanted a whisper.	48
9145	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	3	“Ah,” said Harry.	49
9146	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	17	“Stegosaurus says he will come out but only if he can have a ride on your digger.”	50
9147	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	5	And do you know what?	51
9148	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	7	The boy nodded and passed it over.	52
9149	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	12	When Harry and the boy got back, Mrs Rance said, “Oh good!	53
9150	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	1	Dinosaurs.	54
9151	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	3	I love dinosaurs.	55
9152	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	3	Do they Raaah?”	56
9153	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	10	“RAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!” said the dinosaurs and blew all the windows open.	57
9154	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	5	“My goodness!” said Mrs Rance.	58
9155	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	4	“That was a Raaah!”	59
9156	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	7	They all sat down in the classroom.	60
9157	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	14	“Now, we’re going to make new labels for our coat pegs,” said Mrs Rance.	61
9158	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	9	“Hands up who knows how to write their name?”	62
9159	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	9	The boy with the digger put up his hand.	63
9160	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	10	“And what are you going to write?” smiled Mrs Rance.	64
9161	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	4	“Jackosaurus!” said the boy.	65
9162	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	11	It was the very first word he had spoken all day.	66
9163	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	6	And what a good joke, too!	67
9164	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	7	All the other children laughed and laughed.	68
9165	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	4	Harry felt very happy.	69
9166	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	16	Charlie, Harry and their new friend Jack sat down together at a table with the dinosaurs.	70
9167	Harry and the Dinosaurs go to School	15	They laughed and they Raaahed and they made beautiful labels to show where they belonged.	71
9168	Gruff the Grump	4	Gruff was a bear.	0
9169	Gruff the Grump	4	A great big bear.	1
9170	Gruff the Grump	10	A great big, scowly, growly, grizzly grump of a bear.	2
9171	Gruff the Grump	16	He lived all alone in a musty, dusty old cave where nobody ever came to visit.	3
9172	Gruff the Grump	15	The other animals hid when they saw him coming They called him ‘Gruff the Grump’.	4
9173	Gruff the Grump	10	“HUMPH!” went Gruff the Grump to show he didn’t care.	5
9174	Gruff the Grump	15	One morning, Gruff the Grump was stomping through the forest when he saw something strange...	6
9175	Gruff the Grump	13	It was a small, upside-down rabbit, high in the branches of a tree.	7
9176	Gruff the Grump	7	“Hello, Mr Bear,” said the rabbit, upside-downly.	8
9177	Gruff the Grump	4	“I’m a bit stuck.	9
9178	Gruff the Grump	10	Can you help me down please, thank you very much?”	10
9179	Gruff the Grump	11	“HUMPH!” scowled Gruff the Grump and he turned to walk away.	11
9180	Gruff the Grump	11	“Oh please, Mr Bear, PLEEEEEEASE get me down” pleaded the rabbit.	12
9181	Gruff the Grump	18	Much to Gruff the Grump’s surprise, he found himself lifting the little rabbit gently down to the ground.	13
9182	Gruff the Grump	9	“Thank you, thank you, Mr Bear,” said the rabbit.	14
9183	Gruff the Grump	15	“There was a fallen star caught in the tree so I had to rescue it	15
9184	Gruff the Grump	12	but then I got stuck and then you had to rescue me.	16
9185	Gruff the Grump	10	“Here,” she said with a smile, “you can have it.”	17
9186	Gruff the Grump	17	She carefully put the fallen star in the old bear’s huge, hairy paw and hopped off home.	18
9187	Gruff the Grump	25	Gruff the Grump thought that the ‘star’ looked a lot like a leaf but he took it home anyway and put it on his mantelpiece.	19
9188	Gruff the Grump	20	It was so golden and beautiful that it made him realise just how musty and dusty his cave had become.	20
9189	Gruff the Grump	21	And for the first time in a very long time he dusted the mantelpiece and brushed away some of the cobwebs.	21
9190	Gruff the Grump	17	A few days later, Gruff the Grump was fishing in the river when a log floated past.	22
9191	Gruff the Grump	14	Clinging to the log was a small, soggy rabbit holding an orange pointy thing.	23
9192	Gruff the Grump	8	“Hello, Mr Bear,” said the little rabbit, soggily.	24
9193	Gruff the Grump	13	“Can you help me out of the water please, thank you very much?”	25
9194	Gruff the Grump	5	‘‘Humph!’’ went Gruff the Grump....	26
9195	Gruff the Grump	15	But then he reached over to lift the little rabbit safely on to the riverbank.	27
9196	Gruff the Grump	9	“Thank you, thank you, Mr Bear,” said the rabbit.	28
9197	Gruff the Grump	14	“There was a fallen star in the water and I had to rescue it.	29
9198	Gruff the Grump	7	You are very big and very kind.	30
9199	Gruff the Grump	7	Will you look after it for me?”	31
9200	Gruff the Grump	9	But Gruff the Grump just turned and lumbered away.	32
9201	Gruff the Grump	6	He was feeling a bit funny.	33
9202	Gruff the Grump	8	Nobody had ever, evet called him ‘kind’ before.	34
9203	Gruff the Grump	14	“But Mr Bear, Mr Bear, come back!” cried the little rabbit, running after him.	35
9204	Gruff the Grump	8	“I can’t look after it on my own!”	36
9205	Gruff the Grump	5	“OKAY, OKAY, I’LL TAKE IT!”	37
9206	Gruff the Grump	4	snarled Gruff the Grump.	38
9207	Gruff the Grump	11	And snatching the star, he slammed his cave door behind him.	39
9208	Gruff the Grump	14	Gruff the Grump put the star on the mantelpiece next to his other star.	40
9209	Gruff the Grump	20	They looked so clean and colourful that they made him realise just how grim and grimy his cave still was.	41
9210	Gruff the Grump	21	So for the first time in a very long time he swept up all the old pine needles from the floor.	42
9211	Gruff the Grump	6	Now his cave was very clean.	43
9212	Gruff the Grump	19	But it was bare and empty inside and suddenly Gruff felt like a bear who was empty inside too.	44
9213	Gruff the Grump	5	He started to feel sad...	45
9214	Gruff the Grump	11	And when he’d finished feeling sad he started to feel cross...	46
9215	Gruff the Grump	18	And he was right in the middle of feeling cross when there was a knock on the door.	47
9216	Gruff the Grump	4	“WHAT IS IT NOW?”	48
9217	Gruff the Grump	2	he shouted.	49
9218	Gruff the Grump	12	It was the little rabbit with a whole barrow full of stars.	50
9219	Gruff the Grump	6	“Hello, Mr Bear,” she said worn-outly.	51
9220	Gruff the Grump	14	“There were lots and lots of fallen stars and I had to rescue them..”	52
9221	Gruff the Grump	2	“GO AWAY!”	53
9222	Gruff the Grump	4	Gruff the Grump roared.	54
9223	Gruff the Grump	7	“I DON’T WANT ANY MORE STUPID STARS!”	55
9224	Gruff the Grump	11	Then to his great surprise the little rabbit burst into tears.	56
9225	Gruff the Grump	5	Gruff the Grump felt terrible.	57
9226	Gruff the Grump	15	He wanted the little rabbit to stop crying but he didn’t know what to do.	58
9227	Gruff the Grump	6	He tried pulling silly faces ...	59
9228	Gruff the Grump	4	But that didn’t work.	60
9229	Gruff the Grump	5	He did a funny dance...	61
9230	Gruff the Grump	5	But that didn’t work either.	62
9231	Gruff the Grump	17	Then he sat down next to her and said: “I’m sorry I shouted at you, little rabbit.	63
9232	Gruff the Grump	10	I really am a grizzly old grump of a bear.”	64
9233	Gruff the Grump	10	The little rabbit stopped crying and tried a little smile.	65
9234	Gruff the Grump	15	And for the first time in a very long time, Gruff the Bear smiled too!	66
9235	Gruff the Grump	23	Gruff and the little rabbit scattered the stars around the cave, laughing out loud as they fell like fiery snowflakes all about them.	67
9236	Gruff the Grump	11	The little rabbit stayed and played with Gruff until nearly bedtime.	68
9237	Gruff the Grump	8	“I have to go now,” she said sadly.	69
9238	Gruff the Grump	7	“Will you come again soon?” asked Gruff.	70
9239	Gruff the Grump	2	“Very soon!”	71
9240	Gruff the Grump	4	the little rabbit smiled.	72
9241	Gruff the Grump	9	Then she kissed him goodnight and hopped off home.	73
9242	Gruff the Grump	17	Gruff the Bear gave a great big yawn and snuggled to sleep in his warm, starry bed.	74
9243	Gruff the Grump	13	And for the first time in a very long time, he was happy.	75
9244	Night Monkey Day Monkey	7	The moon shone down on the jungle.	0
9245	Night Monkey Day Monkey	6	Night Monkey climbed up the tree.	1
9246	Night Monkey Day Monkey	15	She clambered and leapt to where Day Monkey slept, And whispered, “You can’t catch me.”	2
9247	Night Monkey Day Monkey	14	Day Monkey woke up and chased her, But lost his grip on the bark.	3
9248	Night Monkey Day Monkey	13	He landed, cross, on a bed of moss, complaining, “It’s much too dark!”	4
9249	Night Monkey Day Monkey	4	“Look!” said Day Monkey.	5
9250	Night Monkey Day Monkey	8	“Hundreds of eyes, Winking and blinking and bright.”	6
9251	Night Monkey Day Monkey	15	Night Monkey laughed and said, “Don’t be daft, They’re fireflies that flash in the night.”	7
9252	Night Monkey Day Monkey	4	“Help!” said Day Monkey.	8
9253	Night Monkey Day Monkey	2	“Flying mice!	9
9254	Night Monkey Day Monkey	7	Or maybe I’m wrong and they’re rats.”	10
9255	Night Monkey Day Monkey	13	Night Monkey laughed and said, “Don’t be daft, Haven’t you heard of bats?”	11
9256	Night Monkey Day Monkey	4	“Stop!” said Day Monkey.	12
9257	Night Monkey Day Monkey	3	“Listen to that!	13
9258	Night Monkey Day Monkey	6	They’re sawing the tree into logs.”	14
9259	Night Monkey Day Monkey	15	“” Night Monkey laughed and said, “Don’t be daft, It’s only a chorus of frogs.”	15
9260	Night Monkey Day Monkey	5	“Hey! ” said Day Monkey.	16
9261	Night Monkey Day Monkey	3	“There’s a banana!	17
9262	Night Monkey Day Monkey	6	How does it manage to fly?”	18
9263	Night Monkey Day Monkey	15	Night Monkey laughed and said, “Don’t be daft, That banana’s the moon in the sky.”	19
9264	Night Monkey Day Monkey	7	Day Monkey yawned and rubbed bis eyes.	20
9265	Night Monkey Day Monkey	5	“Maybe I’m dreaming,” he said.	21
9266	Night Monkey Day Monkey	7	“Night-time is creepy and I’m feeling sleepy.	22
9267	Night Monkey Day Monkey	5	I’m going back to bed.”	23
9268	Night Monkey Day Monkey	7	The sun shone down the next morning.	24
9269	Night Monkey Day Monkey	6	Day Monkey slid down the tree.	25
9270	Night Monkey Day Monkey	15	He slithered and leapt to where Night Monkey slept And whispered, “You can’t catch me!”	26
9271	Night Monkey Day Monkey	12	Night Monkey woke up and chased him, Screwing her eyes up tight.	27
9272	Night Monkey Day Monkey	13	She came to rest in an empty nest, complaining, “It’s much too bright!”	28
9273	Night Monkey Day Monkey	4	“Look!” said Night Monkey.	29
9274	Night Monkey Day Monkey	3	“Moths wearing make-up!	30
9275	Night Monkey Day Monkey	5	Why are they in disguise?”	31
9276	Night Monkey Day Monkey	11	Day Monkey laughed and said, “Don’t be daft, They’re beautiful butterflies.”	32
9277	Night Monkey Day Monkey	4	“Help!” said Night Monkey.	33
9278	Night Monkey Day Monkey	9	“Look at those giants Swinging about in the trees.”	34
9279	Night Monkey Day Monkey	12	Day Monkey laughed and said, “Don’t be daft, Those giants are chimpanzees.”	35
9280	Night Monkey Day Monkey	4	“Stop!” said Night Monkey.	36
9281	Night Monkey Day Monkey	8	“Screeching owls, The colour of peas and carrots!”	37
9282	Night Monkey Day Monkey	13	Day Monkey laughed and said, “Don’t be daft, Haven’t you heard of parrots?”	38
9283	Night Monkey Day Monkey	4	“Hey!” said Night Monkey.	39
9284	Night Monkey Day Monkey	3	“Naughty black monkeys!	40
9285	Night Monkey Day Monkey	7	Can’t they keep out of our way?”	41
9286	Night Monkey Day Monkey	14	Day Monkey laughed and said, “Don’t be daft, Our shadows are here to stay.”	42
9287	Night Monkey Day Monkey	7	Night Monkey yawned and rubbed her eyes.	43
9288	Night Monkey Day Monkey	5	“Maybe I’m dreaming,” she said.	44
9289	Night Monkey Day Monkey	7	“Daytime is crazy and I’m feeling lazy.	45
9290	Night Monkey Day Monkey	5	I’m going back to bed.”	46
9291	Night Monkey Day Monkey	8	Now Night Monkey sleeps in the daylight .And	47
9292	Night Monkey Day Monkey	30	Day Monkey sleeps in the night, But now and again at sunrise when it isn’t quite dark or light, They share a bunch of bananas Half way up a tree.	48
9293	Night Monkey Day Monkey	5	Day Monkey calls it breakfast.	49
9294	Night Monkey Day Monkey	5	Night Monkey calls it tea.	50
9295	The Paper Dolls	39	There was once a girl who had tiger slippers and a ceiling with stars on it and a butterfly hairslide which she kept losing and two goldfish and a nice mother who helped her to make some paper dolls.	0
9296	The Paper Dolls	19	They were Ticky and Tacky and Jackie the Backie and Jim with two noses and Jo with the bow.	1
9297	The Paper Dolls	9	And they danced and they jumped and they sang.	2
9298	The Paper Dolls	16	And they met a dinosaur who clawed and roared, and said, “I’m going to get you!”	3
9299	The Paper Dolls	9	But the paper dolls sang, “You cant get us.	4
9300	The Paper Dolls	4	Oh no no no!	5
9301	The Paper Dolls	8	We’re holding hands and we wont let go.	6
9302	The Paper Dolls	18	Were Ticky and Tacky and Jackie the Backie And Jim with two noses and Jo with the bow!”	7
9303	The Paper Dolls	5	And they jumped ... ..	8
9304	The Paper Dolls	14	on to a bus and rode to a farmyard, and danced with the pigs.	9
9305	The Paper Dolls	32	Then they lay on a rooftop and stared at the stars, till a tiger slunk out of his den and he crouched and snarled and said, “I’ll leap up and catch you!”	10
9306	The Paper Dolls	9	But the paper dolls sang, “You can’t catch us.	11
9307	The Paper Dolls	4	Oh no no no!	12
9308	The Paper Dolls	8	Were holding hands and we won’t let go.	13
9309	The Paper Dolls	18	We’re Ticky and Tacky and Jackie the Backie And Jim with two noses and Jo with the bow!”	14
9310	The Paper Dolls	40	And they floated ... ... down the stairs and they danced round the honey pot and kicked crumbs and explored an island till a fierce crocodile grinned his grin and gnashed his teeth and said, “I’m coming to crunch you!”	15
9311	The Paper Dolls	11	But the paper dolls laughed, and sang, “You can’t crunch us.	16
9312	The Paper Dolls	4	Oh no no no!	17
9313	The Paper Dolls	8	We’re holding hands and we won’t let go.	18
9314	The Paper Dolls	18	We’re Ticky and Tacky and Jackie the Backie And Jim with two noses and Jo with the bow!”	19
9315	The Paper Dolls	5	And they hopped ... ..	20
9316	The Paper Dolls	21	into the garden and they sniffed the flowers and chatted to a ladybird and lay down in a forest of grass.	21
9317	The Paper Dolls	16	But along came a boy with a pair of scissors and he said, “I’ll SNIP you!”	22
9318	The Paper Dolls	3	And he did.	23
9319	The Paper Dolls	14	He snipped them into tiny little pieces and he said, “You’re gone for ever.”	24
9320	The Paper Dolls	8	But the paper dolls sang, “Were not gone.	25
9321	The Paper Dolls	4	Oh no no no!	26
9322	The Paper Dolls	8	Were holding hands and we won’t let go.	27
9323	The Paper Dolls	18	We’re Ticky and Tacky and Jackie the Backie And Jim with two noses and Jo with the bow!”	28
9324	The Paper Dolls	47	And the pieces all joined together, and the paper dolls flew... ... into the little girl’s memory where they found white mice and fireworks, and a starfish soap, and a kind granny, and the butterfly hairslide, and more and more lovely things each day and each year.	29
9325	The Paper Dolls	17	And the girl grew... …into a mother who helped her own little girl make some paper dolls.	30
9326	The Paper Dolls	19	They were Poppy and Pinkie and Binky the Blinkie, and Fred with one eyebrow, and Flo with the bow.	31
9327	The Paper Dolls	9	And they jumped, and they danced, and they sang.	32
9328	Snow White, Star Striker	10	Once upon a time… there was a misty blue mountain.	0
9329	Snow White, Star Striker	19	Below the misty blue mountain was a wild, dark forest and by the wild, dark forest was a village.	1
9330	Snow White, Star Striker	17	The village had a stream and a duck pond and an old red apple tree, Snow White	2
9331	Snow White, Star Striker	9	and it was home to and her fairytale friends.	3
9332	Snow White, Star Striker	4	Snow White loved football.	4
9333	Snow White, Star Striker	21	She practised on her way to school... ... on her way home... - and after dinner, before she went to bed.	5
9334	Snow White, Star Striker	5	dreamed She even about football.	6
9335	Snow White, Star Striker	11	Snow White played on the village football team with her friends.	7
9336	Snow White, Star Striker	22	The team had a match coming up against the ogres from the next village and she was one of their best players.	8
9337	Snow White, Star Striker	9	The only problem was, she wouldn’t pass the ball.	9
9338	Snow White, Star Striker	4	“To me!” yelled Jack.	10
9339	Snow White, Star Striker	4	“Over here!” called Goldilocks.	11
9340	Snow White, Star Striker	9	all the goals Snow White wanted to score herself.	12
9341	Snow White, Star Striker	22	One day, Snow White kicked the ball so far it sailed over the goalposts into Rumpelstiltskin’s garden and broke his garden gnomes.	13
9342	Snow White, Star Striker	3	Rumpelstiltskin was furious.	14
9343	Snow White, Star Striker	2	“Go away!”	15
9344	Snow White, Star Striker	2	he yelled.	16
9345	Snow White, Star Striker	5	“Find somewhere else to play!”	17
9346	Snow White, Star Striker	8	“It’s your fault,” said Goldilocks to Snow White.	18
9347	Snow White, Star Striker	7	“You were too far away to score.	19
9348	Snow White, Star Striker	21	You should have passed the ball” “You’re just not a team player and you’re not fun to play with,” said Jack.	20
9349	Snow White, Star Striker	4	“You’re off the team!”	21
9350	Snow White, Star Striker	12	Snow White still practised but it wasn't the same without her friends.	22
9351	Snow White, Star Striker	6	“Are you all right?” asked Griselda.	23
9352	Snow White, Star Striker	23	“My friends don’t want me to play with them anymore - and Rumpelstiltskin is angry because I broke his gnomes!” said Snow White.	24
9353	Snow White, Star Striker	6	“Rumpelstiltskin isn’t so bad,” replied Griselda.	25
9354	Snow White, Star Striker	13	“Did you know that he was good at football when he was young?	26
9355	Snow White, Star Striker	7	He might even be able to help.”	27
9356	Snow White, Star Striker	14	Snow White went to see Rumpelstiltskin, “I’m sorry for breaking your gnomes,” she said.	28
9357	Snow White, Star Striker	4	“I was playing football	29
9358	Snow White, Star Striker	5	but I messed things up.	30
9359	Snow White, Star Striker	6	Will you help me play better?”	31
9360	Snow White, Star Striker	4	“All right,” said Rumpelstiltskin.	32
9361	Snow White, Star Striker	9	“I will coach you if you help me fix.	33
9362	Snow White, Star Striker	2	my gnomes.”	34
9363	Snow White, Star Striker	4	“Deal!” said Snow White.	35
9364	Snow White, Star Striker	17	The following week, Snow White helped Rumpelstiltskin mend the gnomes, then he taught her some team tactics.	36
9365	Snow White, Star Striker	9	“Can you help us, too?” asked Jack and Goldilocks.	37
9366	Snow White, Star Striker	7	Soon, Rumpelstiltskin was coaching the whole team.	38
9367	Snow White, Star Striker	8	The day of the ogres football match arrived.	39
9368	Snow White, Star Striker	10	“Remember, you can win if you play as a team!”	40
9369	Snow White, Star Striker	3	Rumpelstiltskin told them.	41
9370	Snow White, Star Striker	9	Jack scored first, but the Ogres got one back.	42
9371	Snow White, Star Striker	9	Snow White scored next, but the ogres got another.	43
9372	Snow White, Star Striker	10	It was 2-2 with less than a minute to go!	44
9373	Snow White, Star Striker	6	Then Snow White got the ball.	45
9374	Snow White, Star Striker	4	“To me!” yelled Jack.	46
9375	Snow White, Star Striker	4	“Over here!” called Goldilocks.	47
9376	Snow White, Star Striker	3	Snow White hesitated.	48
9377	Snow White, Star Striker	15	She still wanted to be her team’s star striker but Goldilocks was nearer the goal.	49
9378	Snow White, Star Striker	7	Then she remembered “Play as a team!”	50
9379	Snow White, Star Striker	26	Rumpelstiltskin's words: Snow White took a deep breath and passed the ball to Goldilocks, who kicked it in the net - just as the whistle went.	51
9380	Snow White, Star Striker	5	The Fairytale Friends had won!	52
9381	Snow White, Star Striker	20	“You may not have scored the winning goal, but it’s more fun playing with you now,” Goldilocks told Snow White.	53
9382	Snow White, Star Striker	5	“And you’re still a star!”	54
9383	Snow White, Star Striker	3	Snow White beamed.	55
9384	Snow White, Star Striker	6	“In this team, we’re all stars”	56
9385	Caterpillar Butterfly	18	My father and my grandfather both liked gardening very much, but my grandfather used to grow stinging nettles.	0
9386	Caterpillar Butterfly	12	My father didn't; he said they were weeds, and rooted them out.	1
9387	Caterpillar Butterfly	8	"""Why don't you get rid of your nettles?"""	2
9388	Caterpillar Butterfly	4	I asked my grandfather.	3
9389	Caterpillar Butterfly	6	"""Stinging nettles grow butterflies,"" he said."	4
9390	Caterpillar Butterfly	3	"""Go and look."""	5
9391	Caterpillar Butterfly	4	I went and looked.	6
9392	Caterpillar Butterfly	6	I couldn't see any butterflies, though.	7
9393	Caterpillar Butterfly	26	My grandfather turned one of the nettle leaves over to show me the bumps on the back of it, but I didn't know what they were.	8
9394	Caterpillar Butterfly	5	"""Butterfly eggs,"" said my grandfather."	9
9395	Caterpillar Butterfly	4	"""What sort of butterflies?"""	10
9396	Caterpillar Butterfly	7	My grandfather peered closely at the bumps.	11
9397	Caterpillar Butterfly	14	"""Haven't got my specs on,"" he said, ""but they could be Tortoiseshells, or Peacocks."	12
9398	Caterpillar Butterfly	4	They both like nettles.	13
9399	Caterpillar Butterfly	14	"If you keep an eye on them you'll see when the caterpillars hatch out."""	14
9400	Caterpillar Butterfly	4	"""Won't they crawl away?"""	15
9401	Caterpillar Butterfly	2	I asked.	16
9402	Caterpillar Butterfly	9	My grandfather straightened up and looked down at me.	17
9403	Caterpillar Butterfly	3	"""Humph,"" he said."	18
9404	Caterpillar Butterfly	4	You just keep watching.	19
9405	Caterpillar Butterfly	3	So I did.	20
9406	Caterpillar Butterfly	14	NETTLES WILL STING YOU IF YOU TOUCH THEM, BUT THEY WON’T STING THE CATERPILLARS.	21
9407	Caterpillar Butterfly	8	THE EGGS ARE DOME SHAPED WITH LITTLE RIDGES.	22
9408	Caterpillar Butterfly	12	EACH EGG IS ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE TOP OF A PIN.	23
9409	Caterpillar Butterfly	14	MOST BUTTERFLIES LAY THEIR EGGS IN ONES AND TWOS, MOVING FROM PLANT TO PLANT.	24
9410	Caterpillar Butterfly	10	PEACOCK AND TORTOISESHESS BUTTERFLIES LAY LOTS OF EGGS AT ONCE.	25
9411	Caterpillar Butterfly	7	Nothing happened at all for two days.	26
9412	Caterpillar Butterfly	14	It rained very hard on the second day but the eggs were quite safe.	27
9413	Caterpillar Butterfly	17	The next day there were lots and lots of little tiny caterpillars crawling on the nettle leaves.	28
9414	Caterpillar Butterfly	12	The eggs were papery and empty I squashed some with my fingernail.	29
9415	Caterpillar Butterfly	21	THE CATERPILLARS EAT THEIR WAY OUT OF THE EGGS WHEN THEY’RE READY TO HATCH, AND STAY TOGETHER IN A BIG CROWD.	30
9416	Caterpillar Butterfly	16	THEY MAKE A WEB OF WHITE SILK BETWEEN THE STEM OF THE PLANT AND THE LEAVES.	31
9417	Caterpillar Butterfly	2	IT’S LIKE	32
9418	Caterpillar Butterfly	2	A TENT.	33
9419	Caterpillar Butterfly	15	WHEN THEY’VE EATEN ALL THE LEAVES NEARBY, THEY MOVE ON AND MAKE A NEW TENT.	34
9420	Caterpillar Butterfly	10	My grandfather came over to see what I was doing.	35
9421	Caterpillar Butterfly	5	"“Ah,"" he said, ""Peacock caterpillars."""	36
9422	Caterpillar Butterfly	4	"""Do they eat cabbage?"""	37
9423	Caterpillar Butterfly	2	I asked.	38
9424	Caterpillar Butterfly	5	I'd seen caterpillars on cabbages.	39
9425	Caterpillar Butterfly	4	He shook his head.	40
9426	Caterpillar Butterfly	4	"""Caterpillars are fussy eaters."	41
9427	Caterpillar Butterfly	31	"If you put a nettle-eating caterpillar on a cabbage it'll set off to look for nettles, and if it can't find any it'll sit down and die rather than eat cabbage."""	42
9428	Caterpillar Butterfly	6	SOME OF THE CATERPILLARS YOU SEE	43
9429	Caterpillar Butterfly	5	ON CABBAGES ARE CABBAGE WHITES.	44
9430	Caterpillar Butterfly	3	THEY LOVE CABBAGE.	45
9431	Caterpillar Butterfly	5	ORANGE TIP CATERPILLARS EAT LADY’S	46
9432	Caterpillar Butterfly	4	SMOCK AND GARLIC MUSTARD	47
9433	Caterpillar Butterfly	5	(SOMETIMES THEY EAT EACH OTHER)	48
9434	Caterpillar Butterfly	14	COMMA CATERPILLARS LIKE HOPS BEST, BUT SOMETIMES THEY HAVE TO MAKE DO WITH NETTLES.	49
9435	Caterpillar Butterfly	11	PEACOCK, SMALL TOTOISESHELL AND RED ADMIRAL CATERPILLARS ALL LIKE NETTLES BEST.	50
9436	Caterpillar Butterfly	6	I looked at my Peacock caterpillars.	51
9437	Caterpillar Butterfly	15	They w ere all together in a little crowd, eating as fast as they could.	52
9438	Caterpillar Butterfly	5	"""Won’t the birds eat them?"""	53
9439	Caterpillar Butterfly	2	I asked.	54
9440	Caterpillar Butterfly	5	"""Couldn't we cover them up?"""	55
9441	Caterpillar Butterfly	5	"""No need,"" said my grandfather."	56
9442	Caterpillar Butterfly	13	"""Caterpillars that don't hide away are really saying, 'I'm poisonous - keep off!'"	57
9443	Caterpillar Butterfly	5	"And the birds know that."""	58
9444	Caterpillar Butterfly	17	He pulled his pipe out of his pocket and very, very gently nudged one of the caterpillars.	59
9445	Caterpillar Butterfly	11	It curled itself up at once and fell off the leaf.	60
9446	Caterpillar Butterfly	3	"""There,"" he said."	61
9447	Caterpillar Butterfly	15	"""Even if something does come along looking for a snack, the caterpillar might still escape."""	62
9448	Caterpillar Butterfly	6	"""Can I make one curl up?"""	63
9449	Caterpillar Butterfly	5	I stuck my finger out.	64
9450	Caterpillar Butterfly	6	"""Don’t touch them,"" my grandfather said."	65
9451	Caterpillar Butterfly	18	"""Some spiny caterpillars can give you a rash, and other kinds leave a nasty smell on your fingers."	66
9452	Caterpillar Butterfly	5	Besides, you might hurt them.”	67
9453	Caterpillar Butterfly	6	I went on watching the caterpillars.	68
9454	Caterpillar Butterfly	4	They were getting bigger.	69
9455	Caterpillar Butterfly	25	By the second Saturday in July they had eaten nearly all the plant they had hatched out on and were crawling over the other nettles.	70
9456	Caterpillar Butterfly	13	Some of them were lying completely still, though, and not eating at all.	71
9457	Caterpillar Butterfly	17	All of a sudden one of them gave a little wriggle and its skin split right open.	72
9458	Caterpillar Butterfly	23	Inside was another brand new caterpillar, and it crawled out of the old skin as if it were crawling out of a sleeping-bag.	73
9459	Caterpillar Butterfly	14	It looked quite fresh and clean, and it seemed to be bigger than before.	74
9460	Caterpillar Butterfly	7	All the other caterpillars change skins too.	75
9461	Caterpillar Butterfly	17	I knew something must be eating my caterpillars, because by no there weren't so many of them.	76
9462	Caterpillar Butterfly	22	I didn't mind that, but I did mind five days later when I found that every single one of them had disappeared.	77
9463	Caterpillar Butterfly	4	"""Where have they gone?"""	78
9464	Caterpillar Butterfly	2	I asked.	79
9465	Caterpillar Butterfly	5	I was close to tears.	80
9466	Caterpillar Butterfly	5	"""Pea sticks,"" said my grandfather."	81
9467	Caterpillar Butterfly	14	We marched round the corner of the shed to where the pea sticks were.	82
9468	Caterpillar Butterfly	9	"""Sometimes one or two come here,"" my grandfather said."	83
9469	Caterpillar Butterfly	5	"“Ah, yes, here we are."""	84
9470	Caterpillar Butterfly	15	Sure enough, there was one of the caterpillars, hanging head downwards off a pea stick.	85
9471	Caterpillar Butterfly	22	And to my amazement, before my very eyes, its skin began to peel off from its head upwards ... and shrivelled away.	86
9472	Caterpillar Butterfly	10	This time there wasn't another caterpillar ready to come out.	87
9473	Caterpillar Butterfly	15	Instead there was something like a little soft brown bag, hanging on the pea stick.	88
9474	Caterpillar Butterfly	16	It didn't have legs or eyes or anything, and it dried up into a little case.	89
9475	Caterpillar Butterfly	18	My grandfather said that was just what it was, but the proper name for it was a pupa.	90
9476	Caterpillar Butterfly	5	"""But where's the caterpillar gone?"""	91
9477	Caterpillar Butterfly	2	I asked.	92
9478	Caterpillar Butterfly	15	All the bits of caterpillar were inside the case, he said, and they were changing.	93
9479	Caterpillar Butterfly	19	Just this once, I was allowed to bring the stick with the little case on it into the kitchen.	94
9480	Caterpillar Butterfly	17	I watched for ten whole days and on the tenth day the pupa went very, very dark.	95
9481	Caterpillar Butterfly	14	"The next morning I was eating my breakfast when my grandfather suddenly said, ""LOOK!"""	96
9482	Caterpillar Butterfly	12	I rushed to see, and the case of the pupa had split.	97
9483	Caterpillar Butterfly	13	Something was crawling out... but it didn't look a bit like a butterfly.	98
9484	Caterpillar Butterfly	15	It was crumpled, and it looked damp, and it wasn't at all a pretty colour.	99
9485	Caterpillar Butterfly	10	"""It must have gone wrong,"" I said, feeling very sad."	100
9486	Caterpillar Butterfly	16	Very gently, my grandfather lifted the stick and put it on the window-ledge in the sunshine.	101
9487	Caterpillar Butterfly	9	The creature crawled slowly up the stick, and stopped.	102
9488	Caterpillar Butterfly	8	Little by little it began to stretch out.	103
9489	Caterpillar Butterfly	16	It was just like watching a flower unfolding itself, only it had wings instead of petals.	104
9490	Caterpillar Butterfly	31	And the wings began to tremble, and to shine in the sunlight, and then suddenly there it was - a real butterfly, with spidery legs and its wings spread wide open.	105
9491	Caterpillar Butterfly	11	It was so lovely that I couldn't say anything at all.	106
9492	Caterpillar Butterfly	17	Then its wings fluttered and it flew off into the garden — the very newest butterfly there.	107

9528	Elmer and the Wind	7	It was a very, very windy day.	0
9529	Elmer and the Wind	25	Elmer, the patchwork elephant, was sheltering in a cave with his elephant friends, some birds and cousin Wilbur, who was playing tricks with his voice.	1
9530	Elmer and the Wind	18	The elephants laughed when Wilbur made his voice come from a hole at the back of the cave.	2
9531	Elmer and the Wind	10	“It’s not a good day for flying,” said a bird.	3
9532	Elmer and the Wind	11	“It’s a good day to be a heavy elephant,” chuckled Elmer.	4
9533	Elmer and the Wind	6	“An elephant can’t be blown away.”	5
9534	Elmer and the Wind	16	“I bet even you are afraid to go out in this wind, Elmer,” said the bird.	6
9535	Elmer and the Wind	3	“Afraid?” said Elmer.	7
9536	Elmer and the Wind	3	“Watch this then.	8
9537	Elmer and the Wind	3	Come on, Wilbur.	9
9538	Elmer and the Wind	8	“Come back, don’t be silly,” called the elephants.	10
9539	Elmer and the Wind	11	But Elmer and Wilbur had already gone out into the wind.	11
9540	Elmer and the Wind	20	Once they were behind some trees and out of sight of the others, Elmer led the way into another cave.	12
9541	Elmer and the Wind	7	You’re up to something Elmer,” said Wilbur.	13
9542	Elmer and the Wind	17	“Yes,” laughed Elmer “Make your voice come from out there as if we were still walking away.	14
9543	Elmer and the Wind	4	Sound like me sometimes.”	15
9544	Elmer and the Wind	5	“I get it,” said Wilbur.	16
9545	Elmer and the Wind	16	His voice came from the distance, sounding like Elmer, “It’s hard to move in this wind.”	17
9546	Elmer and the Wind	7	Then, like himself, “Careful, Elmer, hold on.”	18
9547	Elmer and the Wind	9	The elephants heard the voices and started to worry.	19
9548	Elmer and the Wind	7	Wilbur called, “Hold on to something, Elmer.	20
9549	Elmer and the Wind	2	Look out!”	21
9550	Elmer and the Wind	4	“HELP!” came Elmer’s voice.	22
9551	Elmer and the Wind	1	“HELP!	23
9552	Elmer and the Wind	2	I’m flying.”	24
9553	Elmer and the Wind	3	Wilbur called, “ELMER!	25
9554	Elmer and the Wind	2	COME BACK!	26
9555	Elmer and the Wind	1	ELMER!	27
9556	Elmer and the Wind	2	OH, HELP!	28
9557	Elmer and the Wind	1	HELP!”	29
9558	Elmer and the Wind	10	“Elmer’s being blown away, we must help” said an elephant.	30
9559	Elmer and the Wind	12	“If you go out you’ll be blown away too” said a bird.	31
9560	Elmer and the Wind	9	“Form a chain, trunks holding tails,” said another elephant.	32
9561	Elmer and the Wind	16	They crept out of the cave, each elephant holding the tail of the elephant in front.	33
9562	Elmer and the Wind	5	“Look at them” said Elmer.	34
9563	Elmer and the Wind	4	“They do look funny.”	35
9564	Elmer and the Wind	8	“Come back, you’ll be blown away,” called Wilbur.	36
9565	Elmer and the Wind	25	The elephants all started to speak at once, but because they were holding on with their trunks, their voices sounded very strange: ‘“We’ve been fooled!”	37
9566	Elmer and the Wind	2	“The rotters...”	38
9567	Elmer and the Wind	6	“It’s an Elmer and Wilbur trick.’’	39
9568	Elmer and the Wind	12	Then they backed back into the cave and looked funnier than ever.	40
9569	Elmer and the Wind	14	When they were safely back in the cave, Elmer and Wilbur returned as well.	41
9570	Elmer and the Wind	14	The elephants enjoyed the joke but a bird said “That was very silly, Elmer.”	42
9571	Elmer and the Wind	11	“But really Bird” said Elmer, “an elephant can’t be blown away.	43
9572	Elmer and the Wind	10	I’ll walk to those trees and back to prove it.”	44
9573	Elmer and the Wind	9	“Another trick” said an elephant as Elmer walked away.	45
9574	Elmer and the Wind	8	They watched as Elmer disappeared behind some trees.	46
9575	Elmer and the Wind	7	Then they heard Elmer’s voice calling, “Help!	47
9576	Elmer and the Wind	6	I can’t keep on the ground.”	48
9577	Elmer and the Wind	6	The elephants laughed, “Very funny, Wilbur.”	49
9578	Elmer and the Wind	5	The voice came again, “HELP!	50
9579	Elmer and the Wind	2	I’M FLYING!”	51
9580	Elmer and the Wind	6	The elephants laughed louder than ever.	52
9581	Elmer and the Wind	7	“It’s not me this time,” said Wilbur.	53
9582	Elmer and the Wind	4	“Look!” said a bird.	54
9583	Elmer and the Wind	3	“It isn’t Wilbur.”	55
9584	Elmer and the Wind	9	The elephants stared: there was Elmer above the trees.	56
9585	Elmer and the Wind	8	“What’s he doing up there?” gasped an elephant.	57
9586	Elmer and the Wind	6	“It’s called flying,” said a bird.	58
9587	Elmer and the Wind	5	“Poor Elmer,” said an elephant.	59
9588	Elmer and the Wind	5	“It’s my ears,” thought Elmer.	60
9589	Elmer and the Wind	4	“They’re acting as wings.”	61
9590	Elmer and the Wind	21	Wilbur and the others seemed very small as he flew away “This is really, quite fun,” thought Elmer after a while.	62
9591	Elmer and the Wind	10	He could see the other animals sheltering from the wind.	63
9592	Elmer and the Wind	8	They stared to see an elephant fly by.	64
9593	Elmer and the Wind	5	“It’s Elmer,” said a lion.'	65
9594	Elmer and the Wind	9	“I expect he’s up to another of his tricks.”	66
9595	Elmer and the Wind	8	At last the wind dropped and Elmer landed.	67
9596	Elmer and the Wind	12	“Oh dear,” he thought, “It’s going to be a long walk home.	68
9597	Elmer and the Wind	8	It serves me right for being so silly.”	69
9598	Elmer and the Wind	16	When the wind stopped, the birds flew off to find Elmer and help guide him home.	70
9599	Elmer and the Wind	18	When at last the elephants saw the birds flying above the trees, they knew that Elmer was near.	71
9600	Elmer and the Wind	10	They rushed to meet him to hear about his adventure.	72
9601	Elmer and the Wind	7	“You were wrong, Elmer,” said the bird.	73
9602	Elmer and the Wind	6	“An elephant can be blown away.”	74
9603	Elmer and the Wind	7	“You were wrong too, bird,” laughed Elmer.	75
9604	Elmer and the Wind	7	“It was a lovely day for flying!”	76

9648	Eleanor Won't Share	5	Eleanor was a sweet girl.	0
9649	Eleanor Won't Share	3	She really was.	1
9650	Eleanor Won't Share	5	But Eleanor had a problem.	2
9651	Eleanor Won't Share	3	A BIG problem.	3
9652	Eleanor Won't Share	6	Eleanor did not like to share.	4
9653	Eleanor Won't Share	11	So Eleanor made a list of rules to make sharing easier.	5
9654	Eleanor Won't Share	7	I. Always share things you don't like.	6
9655	Eleanor Won't Share	9	2. Always share things that belong to other people.	7
9656	Eleanor Won't Share	11	3. Always share when it makes things more fun... for you!	8
9657	Eleanor Won't Share	12	When Eleanor got a bag of sweets, she sorted them by colour.	9
9658	Eleanor Won't Share	10	She gave the black ones away and ate the rest.	10
9659	Eleanor Won't Share	5	“The black ones are yucky!”	11
9660	Eleanor Won't Share	2	Eleanor said.	12
9661	Eleanor Won't Share	7	Eleanor did not like sharing her dolls.	13
9662	Eleanor Won't Share	11	But she always used the dolls’ clothes her friend brought over.	14
9663	Eleanor Won't Share	8	"""I just love sharing your things,” Eleanor said."	15
9664	Eleanor Won't Share	15	Eleanor never wanted to share her bricks - unless she needed someone to play with.	16
9665	Eleanor Won't Share	1	"""See?"	17
9666	Eleanor Won't Share	7	"Aren’t you having fun sharing with me?"""	18
9667	Eleanor Won't Share	2	Eleanor said.	19
9668	Eleanor Won't Share	10	At school, Eleanor tried to be nice to her classmates.	20
9669	Eleanor Won't Share	6	She didn't mind sharing her treats.	21
9670	Eleanor Won't Share	12	"""You can have my grapes,"" she told the boy next to her."	22
9671	Eleanor Won't Share	5	"“I don’t like healthy things."""	23
9672	Eleanor Won't Share	7	She didn't mind sharing her painting either.	24
9673	Eleanor Won't Share	10	It was always more fun to paint with a friend.	25
9674	Eleanor Won't Share	9	But Eleanor DID mind sharing in the home corner.	26
9675	Eleanor Won't Share	6	"""Please don't touch that Sparkly gown!"""	27
9676	Eleanor Won't Share	1	“um.	28
9677	Eleanor Won't Share	6	"I was using that cowboy hat."""	29
9678	Eleanor Won't Share	10	"“Excuse me, but I need that top for my outfit."""	30
9679	Eleanor Won't Share	7	Eleanor knew she should share the clothes.	31
9680	Eleanor Won't Share	10	But according to her sharing rules, she didn't have to.	32
9681	Eleanor Won't Share	13	So, every day, Eleanor would take all of the dressing-up clothes for herself.	33
9682	Eleanor Won't Share	8	The other children were NOT happy about it.	34
9683	Eleanor Won't Share	11	Soon, they stopped playing with the dressing-up clothes, and with Eleanor.	35
9684	Eleanor Won't Share	9	One day, Miss Smith taught everyone a new game.	36
9685	Eleanor Won't Share	16	While Eleanor was hoarding all the dressing-up clothes, the other children were laughing and dancing around.	37
9686	Eleanor Won't Share	11	Eleanor collected all the clothes and headed over to the game.	38
9687	Eleanor Won't Share	6	"“Can I play the new game?"""	39
9688	Eleanor Won't Share	2	Eleanor asked.	40
9689	Eleanor Won't Share	4	But nobody heard her.	41
9690	Eleanor Won't Share	6	“Can I play the new game?”	42
9691	Eleanor Won't Share	2	Eleanor shouted.	43
9692	Eleanor Won't Share	10	This time everyone heard her, but nobody seemed to care.	44
9693	Eleanor Won't Share	5	"""It’s not fair,"" Eleanor said."	45
9694	Eleanor Won't Share	7	“You are supposed to let everyone play.”	46
9695	Eleanor Won't Share	12	"“We don't want to play with someone who doesn't share,"" Adam said."	47
9696	Eleanor Won't Share	6	"“That’s not very nice,"" Eleanor said."	48
9697	Eleanor Won't Share	8	"""Neither is hoarding the dressing-up clothes,"" Lilly said."	49
9698	Eleanor Won't Share	3	Eleanor thought hard.	50
9699	Eleanor Won't Share	7	Then she took off the cowboy hat.	51
9700	Eleanor Won't Share	6	She took off the top, too.	52
9701	Eleanor Won't Share	10	And finally, she took off the fancy flown and crown.	53
9702	Eleanor Won't Share	9	The other children let her play the new game.	54
9703	Eleanor Won't Share	18	"After class, Miss Smith whispered to Eleanor, “It's always good to share, even when you don’t want to."""	55
9704	Eleanor Won't Share	18	"Eleanor whispered back, ""From now on I will try to share - even when I don’t want to."""	56
9705	Eleanor Won't Share	2	"“That's great!"""	57
9706	Eleanor Won't Share	3	Miss Smith said.	58
9707	Eleanor Won't Share	2	"“Miss Smith?"""	59
9708	Eleanor Won't Share	2	Eleanor asked.	60
9709	Eleanor Won't Share	11	"""There is something I want to Share with you right now."""	61
9710	Eleanor Won't Share	5	"""What’s that?"" asked Miss Smith."	62
9711	Eleanor Won't Share	2	"""A hug!"""	63
9712	Romp in the Swamp	11	Mum and Nan were taking Sam to see her new school.	0
9713	Romp in the Swamp	17	That was why Harry and the dinosaurs had to go and play with some girl called Charlie.	1
9714	Romp in the Swamp	9	Harry called their names but the dinosaurs were hiding.	2
9715	Romp in the Swamp	9	“Don’t let Charlie play with us, Harry,” said Apatosaurus.	3
9716	Romp in the Swamp	9	“She might do bending on our legs,” said Anchisaurus.	4
9717	Romp in the Swamp	7	“She might chew our tails,” said Triceratops.	5
9718	Romp in the Swamp	7	“She won’t understand about dinosaurs,” said Scelidosaurus.	6
9719	Romp in the Swamp	4	“Don’t worry,” said Harry.	7
9720	Romp in the Swamp	5	“You get in the bucket.	8

9722	Romp in the Swamp	8	“What took you so long, slowcoach?” said Sam.	10
9723	Romp in the Swamp	5	“None of your business!” said	11
9724	Romp in the Swamp	1	Harry.	12
9725	Romp in the Swamp	6	Good thing Nan sat between them.	13
9726	Romp in the Swamp	11	Charlie and her mum came to the door to meet Harry.	14
9727	Romp in the Swamp	7	Harry hid the dinosaurs behind his back.	15
9728	Romp in the Swamp	3	“Goodbye!” called Mum.	16
9729	Romp in the Swamp	4	“Have a good time!”	17
9730	Romp in the Swamp	8	Harry and the dinosaurs didn’t think they would.	18
9731	Romp in the Swamp	11	Charlie went inside and sat on the sofa with her toys.	19
9732	Romp in the Swamp	9	Harry sat at the other end of the sofa.	20
9733	Romp in the Swamp	7	He guarded the dinosaurs and wouldn’t speak.	21
9734	Romp in the Swamp	9	Then Charlie went off and found a big basket.	22
9735	Romp in the Swamp	8	In went her dumper truck and her tractor.	23
9736	Romp in the Swamp	8	In went some cushions, in went some boxes.	24
9737	Romp in the Swamp	10	In went some pans and some plants and some string.	25
9738	Romp in the Swamp	9	Harry and the dinosaurs followed her into the garden.	26
9739	Romp in the Swamp	6	“What is she doing?” whispered Harry.	27
9740	Romp in the Swamp	7	“She’s making a primeval forest!” said Anchisaurus.	28
9741	Romp in the Swamp	6	“And a primordial swamp!” said Triceratops.	29
9742	Romp in the Swamp	5	“That looks fun!” said Stegosaurus.	30
9743	Romp in the Swamp	9	“Hisssssss” went the hose like a great big snake.	31
9744	Romp in the Swamp	2	“Look out!”	32
9745	Romp in the Swamp	2	Harry shouted.	33
9746	Romp in the Swamp	5	“That snake might bite us!	34
9747	Romp in the Swamp	5	Oh no, he’s squeezing Tyrannosaurus!	35
9748	Romp in the Swamp	1	Quick!	36
9749	Romp in the Swamp	2	Save him!”	37
9750	Romp in the Swamp	9	Harry and the dinosaurs joined in the noisy game.	38
9751	Romp in the Swamp	6	Anchisaurus went crash with the tractor.	39
9752	Romp in the Swamp	7	Scelidosaurus went bump with the dumper truck.	40
9753	Romp in the Swamp	11	Apatosaurus and Triceratops made a strong snake- lead out of string.	41
9754	Romp in the Swamp	5	Stegosaurus grabbed the snake’s tail.	42
9755	Romp in the Swamp	8	“Help me with the snake cage!” shouted Charlie.	43
9756	Romp in the Swamp	9	Whump went the snake cage and captured the snake!	44
9757	Romp in the Swamp	3	“Raaaaah!” said Tyrannosaurus.	45
9758	Romp in the Swamp	6	“You can’t catch me, Mister Snaky!”	46
9759	Romp in the Swamp	6	Then everyone did a noisy capture-dance.	47
9760	Romp in the Swamp	3	“Hooray!” said Charlie.	48
9761	Romp in the Swamp	5	“What shall we do now?”	49
9762	Romp in the Swamp	7	“Let’s all have a feast!” said Harry.	50
9763	Romp in the Swamp	11	“Would you like to play with Charlie another day?” called Mum.	51
9764	Romp in the Swamp	3	“Definitely!” said Harry.	52
9765	Romp in the Swamp	4	“Definitely!” said the dinosaurs.	53
9766	The Polar Express	12	On Christmas Eve, many years ago, 1 lay quietly in my bed.	0
9767	The Polar Express	6	1 did not rustle the sheets.	1
9768	The Polar Express	6	I breathed slowly a nd silently.	2
9769	The Polar Express	25	I was listening for a sound - a sound a friend had told me I’d never hear - t he ringing bells of Santa’s sleigh.	3
9770	The Polar Express	14	“There is no Santa,” my friend had insisted, but 1 knew he was wrong.	4
9771	The Polar Express	24	Late that night I did hear sounds, though not of ringing bells, from outside came the sounds of hissing ste am and squeaking metal.	5
9772	The Polar Express	17	1 looked through my window and saw a train standing perfectly still in front of my house.	6
9773	The Polar Express	8	It was wrapped in an apron of steam.	7
9774	The Polar Express	5	Snowflakes fell lightly around it.	8
9775	The Polar Express	12	A guard stood at the open door of one of the cars.	9
9776	The Polar Express	15	He took a large pocket watch from his jacket, then looked up at my window.	10
9777	The Polar Express	7	I put on my slippers and dressing-gown.	11
9778	The Polar Express	9	1 tiptoed downstairs and out of th e door.	12
9779	The Polar Express	6	“All aboard,” the guard cried out.	13
9780	The Polar Express	5	I ran up to him.	14
9781	The Polar Express	7	“Well,” he said, “ar e you coming?”	15
9782	The Polar Express	3	“Where?” I asked.	16
9783	The Polar Express	11	“Why, to the North Pole, of c ourse,” was his answer.	17
9784	The Polar Express	5	"“This is the Polar Express."""	18
9785	The Polar Express	10	I took his outstretched hand and he pulled me aboard.	19
9786	The Polar Express	13	The train was filled with other children, all in their pyjamas and nightgowns.	20
9787	The Polar Express	14	We sang Christmas carols and ate sweets with nougat centres as white as snow.	21
9788	The Polar Express	13	We drank hot cocoa as thick and rich a s melted chocolate bats.	22
9789	The Polar Express	17	Outside, the lights of towns and villages flickered in the distance as the Polar Express raced northwards.	23
9790	The Polar Express	9	Soon there were no more lights to be seen.	24
9791	The Polar Express	25	We travelled through cold, dark forests, where lean wolves roamed and white- tailed rabbits hid from our train as it thundered through the quiet wilderness.	25
9792	The Polar Express	14	We climbed mountains so high it seemed as if we would scrape the moon.	26
9793	The Polar Express	7	But the Polar Express never slowed down.	27
9794	The Polar Express	19	Faster and faster we ran along, rolling over peaks and through valleys like a car on a roller coaster.	28
9795	The Polar Express	10	The mountains turned into hills, the hills to snow-coveted plains.	29
9796	The Polar Express	14	We crossed a barren desert of ice - the Great P olar Ice Cap.	30
9797	The Polar Express	5	Lights appeared in the distance.	31
9798	The Polar Express	16	They looke d like the lights of a strange ocean liner sailing on a frozen sea.	32
9799	The Polar Express	8	“There,” said the guard, “is the North Pole.”	33
9800	The Polar Express	4	Tfc The North Pole.	34
9801	The Polar Express	23	It was a huge city standing alone at the top of the world, filled with factories where ever y Christmas toy was made.	35
9802	The Polar Express	6	At first we saw no elves.	36
9803	The Polar Express	13	“They ate gathering at the centre of the city” the guard told us.	37
9804	The Polar Express	12	“That is where Santa will give th e first gift of Christmas.”	38
9805	The Polar Express	6	“Who receives th e first gift?”	39
9806	The Polar Express	3	we all asked.	40
9807	The Polar Express	10	The guard answered, “He w ill choose one of you.”	41
9808	The Polar Express	8	“Look,” shouted one of the children, “the elves.”	42
9809	The Polar Express	6	Outside we saw hundreds of elves.	43
9810	The Polar Express	25	As our train drew closer to the centre of the North Pole, we slowed to a crawl, so crowded were the streets with Santa’s helpers.	44
9811	The Polar Express	17	When the Polar Express could go no farther, we stopped an d the guard led us outside.	45
9812	The Polar Express	13	We pressed through the crowd to the edge of a large, open circle.	46
9813	The Polar Express	7	In front of us stood Santa’s sleigh.	47
9814	The Polar Express	4	The reindeer were excited.	48
9815	The Polar Express	14	They pranced and paced, ringing the silver sleigh bells that hung from their harnesses.	49
9816	The Polar Express	11	It was a magical sound, like noth ing I’d ever heard.	50
9817	The Polar Express	11	Across the circle, the elves moved apart and Santa Claus appeared.	51
9818	The Polar Express	4	The elves cheered wildly.	52
9819	The Polar Express	15	He marched over to us and, pointing to me, said, “Let’s have this fellow here.”	53
9820	The Polar Express	5	He jumped into his sleigh.	54
9821	The Polar Express	5	The guard helped me up.	55
9822	The Polar Express	15	I sat on Santa’s knee and he asked, “Now; what would you like for Christmas?”	56
9823	The Polar Express	11	1 knew that I could have any gift I could imagine.	57
9824	The Polar Express	15	But the thing 1 wanted most for Ch ristmas was not inside Santa’s giant bag.	58
9825	The Polar Express	13	What I wanted more than anything was one silver bell from Santa’s sleigh.	59
9826	The Polar Express	5	When I asked, Santa smiled.	60
9827	The Polar Express	18	Then he gave me a hug and told an elf to cut a bell from a reindeer’s harness.	61
9828	The Polar Express	7	The elf tossed it up to Santa.	62
9829	The Polar Express	16	He stood, holding the bell high above him, and called out, “The first gift of Christmas!”	63
9830	The Polar Express	10	A clock struck midnight as the elves roared their approval.	64
9831	The Polar Express	14	Santa handed the bell to me, and I put it in my dressing-gown pocket.	65
9832	The Polar Express	8	The guard helped me down from the sleigh.	66
9833	The Polar Express	10	Santa shouted out the reindeers' names and cracked his whip.	67
9834	The Polar Express	9	His team charged forward and climbed into the air.	68
9835	The Polar Express	14	Santa circled once above us, then disapp eared in the cold, dark polar sky.	69
9836	The Polar Express	18	As soon as we were back inside the Polar Express, the other children asked to see the bell.	70
9837	The Polar Express	14	I reached into my pocket, but the only- thing I felt was a hole.	71
9838	The Polar Express	10	I had lost the silver bell from Santa Claus’s sleigh.	72
9839	The Polar Express	13	“Let’s hurry outside and look for it,” on e of the children said.	73
9840	The Polar Express	16	Bur the train gave a sudden lurch and started moving We were on our way home.	74
9841	The Polar Express	8	It broke my heart to lose the bell.	75
9842	The Polar Express	12	When the train reached my house, I sadly left the other children.	76
9843	The Polar Express	8	I stood at my doorway and waved goodbye.	77
9844	The Polar Express	14	The guard said something from the moving train, but I could n’t hear him.	78
9845	The Polar Express	1	“What?”	79
9846	The Polar Express	3	I yelled out.	80
9847	The Polar Express	7	He cupped his hands around his mouth.	81
9848	The Polar Express	5	"“MERRY CHRISTM AS,"" he shouted."	82
9849	The Polar Express	14	The Polar Express let out a loud blast from its whistle and sped away.	83
9850	The Polar Express	12	On Christmas morning my little sister Sarah and I opened our presents.	84
9851	The Polar Express	18	When it looked as if everything had been unwrapped, Sarah found one last small box behind the tree.	85
9852	The Polar Express	6	It had my name on it.	86
9853	The Polar Express	6	Inside was th e silver bell!	87
9854	The Polar Express	12	There was a note: “Found this on the scat of my sleigh.	88
9855	The Polar Express	6	Fix that hole in your pocket.”	89
9856	The Polar Express	8	"Signed, "" Mr. G” I shook the bell."	90
9857	The Polar Express	14	It made the most beautifu l sound my sister and 1 had ever heard.	91
9858	The Polar Express	9	But my mother said, “Oh, that’s too b ad.”	92
9859	The Polar Express	6	“Yes,” said my father, “it’s broken.”	93
9860	The Polar Express	12	When I’d shaken the bell, my parents had not heard a sound.	94
9861	The Polar Express	22	At one time most of my friends could hear the bell, but as years passed, it fell silent for all of them.	95
9862	The Polar Express	14	Even Sarah found one Christmas that she could no longer hear its sweet sound.	96
9863	The Polar Express	19	Though I’ve grown old, t he bell still rings for me as it does for all who truly believe.	97

10063	Elmer and Rose	31	A young friend of Elmer's named Rose Blushes from her head to her toes, Or sometimes instead From her toes to her head But never from her tail to her nose.	0
10064	Elmer and Rose	9	Elmer, the patchwork elephant, was with his cousin Wilbur.	1
10065	Elmer and Rose	8	They were looking at the herd of elephants.	2
10066	Elmer and Rose	8	"""Jolly fellows,” smiled Wilbur, “but not exactly unique.”"	3
10067	Elmer and Rose	5	“They’re all unique,” said Elmer.	4
10068	Elmer and Rose	6	“Just not as different as us.	5
10069	Elmer and Rose	7	Imagine a herd like you or me.”	6
10070	Elmer and Rose	12	At that moment Bird arrived and said, “Grandpa Eldo wants you two.”	7
10071	Elmer and Rose	5	“Come on, Wilbur,” said Elmer.	8
10072	Elmer and Rose	7	Grandpa Eldo was looking under a bush.	9
10073	Elmer and Rose	3	'Where is she?”	10
10074	Elmer and Rose	2	he muttered.	11
10075	Elmer and Rose	14	Then, seeing Elmer and Wilbur, he said, “She must be hiding from you two.”	12
10076	Elmer and Rose	1	“She?	13
10077	Elmer and Rose	2	Said Elmer.	14
10078	Elmer and Rose	5	“Who are you talking about?”	15
10079	Elmer and Rose	3	“Rose,” said Eldo.	16
10080	Elmer and Rose	11	“She wandered away from a herd of elephants that passed nearby.	17
10081	Elmer and Rose	8	You two can take her back to them.	18
10082	Elmer and Rose	1	Ah!	19
10083	Elmer and Rose	3	There she is.	20
10084	Elmer and Rose	4	Don’t be frightened, Rose.	21
10085	Elmer and Rose	6	Come and meet Elmer and Wilbur.”	22
10086	Elmer and Rose	11	From behind a tree peeped a young elephant: a pink elephant.	23
10087	Elmer and Rose	7	“Oh!” said Elmer and Wilbur in surprise.	24
10088	Elmer and Rose	5	“Very pretty,” Elmer added quickly.	25
10089	Elmer and Rose	4	Rose became even pinker.	26
10090	Elmer and Rose	6	“She blushes very easily,” whispered Eldo.	27
10091	Elmer and Rose	7	“I expect that’s why she’s called ‘Rose’.”	28
10092	Elmer and Rose	9	Rose said, “Pleased to meet you,” and blushed again.	29
10093	Elmer and Rose	15	“You’ll find the tracks of the herd by the lake, just follow them,” said Eldo.	30
10094	Elmer and Rose	6	“You’ll go faster than I would.	31
10095	Elmer and Rose	2	Goodbye, Rose.”	32
10096	Elmer and Rose	15	Rose said, “goodbye” very sweetly, blushed a deeper pink and ran after Elmer and Wilbur.	33
10097	Elmer and Rose	7	At the lake they met another elephant.	34
10098	Elmer and Rose	8	Rose stared and hid between Elmer and Wilbur.	35
10099	Elmer and Rose	2	“Hello, Elmer.	36
10100	Elmer and Rose	5	Hello, Wilbur,” said the elephant.	37
10101	Elmer and Rose	7	“Hello...” he continued awkwardly, looking at Rose.	38
10102	Elmer and Rose	4	“Rose,” said Elmer helpfully.	39
10103	Elmer and Rose	11	After the elephant had gone, Rose said, “That’s a strange one.”	40
10104	Elmer and Rose	13	Every so often, to make the journey more fun, they raced each other.	41
10105	Elmer and Rose	15	Rose loved that because somehow she always won, and every time she blushed even pinker.	42
10106	Elmer and Rose	8	Between races Wilbur played tricks with his voice.	43
10107	Elmer and Rose	14	He made his voice roar from behind a rock and shout from a treetop.	44
10108	Elmer and Rose	13	Rose squealed with excitement, blushed almost red and held on to Elmer’s trunk.	45
10109	Elmer and Rose	3	Elmer just chuckled.	46
10110	Elmer and Rose	5	Suddenly Rose said excitedly, “Listen!	47
10111	Elmer and Rose	5	They’re just over the hill.	48
10112	Elmer and Rose	4	I’ll go alone now.	49
10113	Elmer and Rose	8	You may upset the others, they’re quite shy.	50
10114	Elmer and Rose	12	You’re all such unusual elephants, especially the strange grey one we saw.	51
10115	Elmer and Rose	6	Thank you for bringing me back.”	52
10116	Elmer and Rose	9	“Come and visit us sometime,” Elmer called after her.	53
10117	Elmer and Rose	3	“Strange grey one?	54
10118	Elmer and Rose	6	What did she mean?” asked Wilbur.	55
10119	Elmer and Rose	7	“I think she was joking,” said Elmer.	56
10120	Elmer and Rose	10	From the hill they watched Rose safely join the herd.	57
10121	Elmer and Rose	5	“She wasn’t joking,” said Elmer.	58
10122	Elmer and Rose	8	“No wonder she found the grey elephant strange.”	59
10123	Elmer and Rose	9	The elephants in Rose’s herd were all. . .	60
10124	Elmer and Rose	1	PINK!	61
10125	Elmer and Rose	9	Going home, Elmer and Wilbur were met by Eldo.	62
10126	Elmer and Rose	12	“You knew about the pink elephants, didn’t you, Grandpa Eldo?” said Elmer.	63
10127	Elmer and Rose	9	“Yes, I wanted you to see them,” said Eldo.	64
10128	Elmer and Rose	5	“Rose was nice,” said Wilbur.	65
10129	Elmer and Rose	13	“I thought she was unique, and she thought the grey elephant was unique.”	66
10130	Elmer and Rose	11	“They’re probably all nice, unique or not,” said Elmer. Wilbur grinned.	67
10131	Elmer and Rose	5	“Remember what you said, Elmer.	68
10132	Elmer and Rose	7	Imagine a herd like one of us.”	69
10133	Elmer and Rose	6	‘Especially like you, Elmer,” laughed Eldo.	70
10134	Elmer and Rose	5	Elmer smiled and said nothing.	71
10135	Elmer and Rose	12	He was imagining a herd of elephants like himself . . .	72
10136	The Smartest Giant in Town	9	George was a giant, the scruffiest giant in town.	0
10137	The Smartest Giant in Town	16	He always wore the same pair of old brown sandals and the same old patched-up gown.	1
10138	The Smartest Giant in Town	12	“I wish I wasn’t the scruffiest giant in town,” he said sadly.	2
10139	The Smartest Giant in Town	8	But one day, George noticed a new shop.	3
10140	The Smartest Giant in Town	6	It was full of smart clothes.	4
10141	The Smartest Giant in Town	33	So he bought a smart shirt, a smart pair of trousers, a smart belt, a smart stripy tie, some smart socks with diamonds up the sides, and a pair of smart shiny shoes.	5
10142	The Smartest Giant in Town	10	“Now I’m the smartest giant in town,” he said proudly.	6
10143	The Smartest Giant in Town	9	George left his old clothes behind in the shop.	7
10144	The Smartest Giant in Town	11	He was about to go home when he heard a sound.	8
10145	The Smartest Giant in Town	10	On the pavement stood a giraffe who was sniffing sadly.	9
10146	The Smartest Giant in Town	5	“What’s the matter?” asked George.	10
10147	The Smartest Giant in Town	14	‘It’s my neck,” said the giraffe, “It’s so very long and so very cold.	11
10148	The Smartest Giant in Town	8	I wish I had a long, warm scarf!”	12
10149	The Smartest Giant in Town	11	"""Cheer up!” said George, and he took off his stripy tie."	13
10150	The Smartest Giant in Town	18	“It didn’t match my socks anyway,” he said, as he wound it round and round the giraffe’s neck.	14
10151	The Smartest Giant in Town	5	It made a wonderful scarf.	15
10152	The Smartest Giant in Town	5	"""Thank you!” said the giraffe."	16
10153	The Smartest Giant in Town	31	As George strode towards home, he sang to himself, “My tie is a scarf for a cold giraffe, But look me up and down - I’m the smartest giant in town.”	17
10154	The Smartest Giant in Town	5	George came to a river.	18
10155	The Smartest Giant in Town	10	On a boat stood a goat who was bleating loudly.	19
10156	The Smartest Giant in Town	5	“What’s the matter?” asked George.	20
10157	The Smartest Giant in Town	6	‘It’s my sail,” said the goat.	21
10158	The Smartest Giant in Town	6	“It blew away in a storm.	22
10159	The Smartest Giant in Town	11	“I wish I had a strong new sail for my boat!”	23
10160	The Smartest Giant in Town	12	"“Cheer up!"" said George, and he took off his new white shirt."	24
10161	The Smartest Giant in Town	18	“It kept coming untucked anyway,” he said, as he tied it to the mast of the goat’s boat.	25
10162	The Smartest Giant in Town	5	It made a magnificent sail.	26
10163	The Smartest Giant in Town	5	“Thank you!” said the goat.	27
10164	The Smartest Giant in Town	39	"George strode on, singing to himself, ""My tie is a scarf for a cold giraffe, My shirt's on a boat as a sail for a goat, But look me up and down - I’m the smartest giant in town!”"	28
10165	The Smartest Giant in Town	7	George came to a tiny ruined house.	29
10166	The Smartest Giant in Town	12	Beside the house stood a white mouse with lots of baby mice.	30
10167	The Smartest Giant in Town	4	They were all squeaking.	31
10168	The Smartest Giant in Town	5	“What’s the matter?” asked George.	32
10169	The Smartest Giant in Town	7	“It’s our house,” squeaked the mother mouse.	33
10170	The Smartest Giant in Town	10	“It burned down, and now we have nowhere to live.	34
10171	The Smartest Giant in Town	8	“I wish we had a nice new house!”	35
10172	The Smartest Giant in Town	13	“Cheer up!” said George, and he took off one of his shiny shoes.	36
10173	The Smartest Giant in Town	16	“It was giving me blisters anyway,” he said, as the mouse and her babies scrambled inside.	37
10174	The Smartest Giant in Town	8	The shoe made a perfect home for them.	38
10175	The Smartest Giant in Town	2	“Thank you!”	39
10176	The Smartest Giant in Town	2	they squeaked.	40
10177	The Smartest Giant in Town	12	George had to hop along the road now, but he didn’t mind.	41
10178	The Smartest Giant in Town	50	As he hopped, he sang to himself, “My tie is a scarf for a cold giraffe, My shirt’s on a boat as a sail for a goat, My shoe is a house for a little white mouse, But look me up and down - I’m the smartest giant in town.”	42
10179	The Smartest Giant in Town	5	George came to a campsite.	43
10180	The Smartest Giant in Town	9	Beside a tent stood a fox who was crying.	44
10181	The Smartest Giant in Town	5	“What’s the matter?” asked George.	45
10182	The Smartest Giant in Town	7	“It’s my sleeping bag,” said the fox.	46
10183	The Smartest Giant in Town	6	“I dropped it in a puddle.	47
10184	The Smartest Giant in Town	9	I wish I had a warm, dry sleeping bag!”	48
10185	The Smartest Giant in Town	17	“Cheer up!” said George, and he took off one of his socks with diamonds up the sides.	49
10186	The Smartest Giant in Town	14	“It was tickling my toes anyway,” he said, as the fox snuggled into it.	50
10187	The Smartest Giant in Town	7	It made a very fine sleeping bag.	51
10188	The Smartest Giant in Town	5	“Thank you!” said the fox.	52
10189	The Smartest Giant in Town	59	George hopped on, singing to himself, “My tie is a scarf for a cold giraffe, My shirt’s on a boat as a sail for a goat, My shoe is a house for a little white mouse, One of my socks is a bed for a fox, But look me up and down - I’m the smartest giant in town.”	53
10190	The Smartest Giant in Town	7	George came to a big squelchy bog.	54
10191	The Smartest Giant in Town	9	Beside the bog stood a dog who was howling.	55
10192	The Smartest Giant in Town	5	“What’s the matter?” asked George.	56
10193	The Smartest Giant in Town	6	“It’s this bog,” said the dog.	57
10194	The Smartest Giant in Town	13	“I need to get across, but I keep getting stuck in the mud.	58
10195	The Smartest Giant in Town	8	“I wish there was a safe, dry path.”	59
10196	The Smartest Giant in Town	12	“Cheer up!” said George, and he took off his smart new belt.	60
10197	The Smartest Giant in Town	16	“It was squashing my tummy anyway,” he said, as he laid it down over the bog.	61
10198	The Smartest Giant in Town	5	It made an excellent path.	62
10199	The Smartest Giant in Town	5	“Thank you!” said the dog.	63
10200	The Smartest Giant in Town	9	The wind started to blow, but George didn’t mind.	64
10201	The Smartest Giant in Town	62	He hopped on, singing to himself, “My tie is a scarf for a cold giraffe, My shirt’s on a boat as a sail for a goat, My shoe is a house for a little white mouse, One of my socks is a bed for a fox, My belt helped a dog who was crossing a bog, But... “My trousers are falling down!	65
10202	The Smartest Giant in Town	6	I’m the coldest giant in town!”	66
10203	The Smartest Giant in Town	11	Suddenly George felt sad and shivery and not at all smart.	67
10204	The Smartest Giant in Town	7	He stood on one foot and thought.	68
10205	The Smartest Giant in Town	15	"""I’ll have to go back to the shop and buy some more clothes,” he decided."	69
10206	The Smartest Giant in Town	13	He turned round and hopped all the way back to the shop.. .•H	70
10207	The Smartest Giant in Town	8	But when he got there, it was CLOSED!	71
10208	The Smartest Giant in Town	4	“Oh, no!” cried George.	72
10209	The Smartest Giant in Town	13	He sank down onto the doorstep and a tear ran down his nose.	73
10210	The Smartest Giant in Town	15	He felt as sad as all the animals he had met on his way home.	74
10211	The Smartest Giant in Town	20	Then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw a bag with something familiar poking out of the top.	75
10212	The Smartest Giant in Town	7	George took a closer look... “My gown!”	76
10213	The Smartest Giant in Town	2	he yelled.	77
10214	The Smartest Giant in Town	6	“My dear old gown and sandals!”	78
10215	The Smartest Giant in Town	4	George put them on.	79
10216	The Smartest Giant in Town	4	They felt wonderfully comfortable.	80
10217	The Smartest Giant in Town	6	“I’m the cosiest giant in town!”	81
10218	The Smartest Giant in Town	10	he cried, and he danced back home along the road.	82
10219	The Smartest Giant in Town	11	Outside his front door stood all the animals he had helped.	83
10220	The Smartest Giant in Town	6	They were carrying an enormous present.	84
10221	The Smartest Giant in Town	5	“Come on, George,” they said.	85
10222	The Smartest Giant in Town	2	“Open it!”	86
10223	The Smartest Giant in Town	4	George untied the ribbon.	87
10224	The Smartest Giant in Town	10	Inside was a beautiful gold paper crown and a card.	88
10225	The Smartest Giant in Town	8	“Look inside the card, George!” said the animals.	89
10226	The Smartest Giant in Town	11	George put the crown on his head and opened the card.	90
10227	The Smartest Giant in Town	73	Inside, it said, Your tie is a scarf for a cold giraffe, your shirt’s on a boat as a sail for a goat, your shoe is a house for a little white mouse, one of your socks is a bed for a fox, your belt helped a dog, who was crossing a bog, so here is a very fine crown, to go with the sandals and gown of the KINDEST giant in town.	91
10228	Supertato Veggies Assemble	14	It was night-time in the supermarket and everyone was sleeping peacefully... or were they?	0
10229	Supertato Veggies Assemble	7	“Mwah ha Someone was looking for trouble.	1

10231	Supertato Veggies Assemble	25	And with one click, ALL the freezers were switched off You may already know this, but some vegetables are frozen for a very good reason.	3

10237	Supertato Veggies Assemble	7	But now there were BAGS of them!	9
10238	Supertato Veggies Assemble	5	The supermarket was in meltdown.	10
10239	Supertato Veggies Assemble	3	“Run for it!”	11
10240	Supertato Veggies Assemble	2	panicked Pepper.	12
10241	Supertato Veggies Assemble	8	“SAVE ME!” stuttered Pear “SAVE ME!” begged Melon.	13
10242	Supertato Veggies Assemble	4	“SAVE ME!” cried Carrot.	14

10244	Supertato Veggies Assemble	4	“And time’s running out!”	16
10245	Supertato Veggies Assemble	7	Was there anyone who could save them?	17
10246	Supertato Veggies Assemble	4	Supertato to the rescue.	18

10269	Supertato Veggies Assemble	7	“You’re going to do what?” asked Supertato.	41
10270	Supertato Veggies Assemble	6	“Three cheers for Supertato!” shouted Broccoli.	42
10271	Supertato Veggies Assemble	2	Supertato blushed.	43
10272	Supertato Veggies Assemble	8	“I couldn’t have done it without the Superveggies.”	44
10273	Supertato Veggies Assemble	10	“Actually, I’m not a vegetable, I’m a fruit,” said Tomato.	45

10295	Wiggling Worms At Work	18	Down in the ground, under your feet, thousands of worms wiggle around flower bulbs and tunnel under trees.	0
10296	Wiggling Worms At Work	10	They twist and turn, eating almost anything in their way.	1
10297	Wiggling Worms At Work	6	These wiggling worms are at work.	2
10298	Wiggling Worms At Work	8	Farmers plow their fields to loosen the soil.	3
10299	Wiggling Worms At Work	11	Crumbly soil lets the roots of plants spread out and grow.	4
10300	Wiggling Worms At Work	9	Worms also loosen the soil as they wiggle along.	5
10301	Wiggling Worms At Work	5	They are called nature's plows.	6
10302	Wiggling Worms At Work	10	As worms twist and turn, they push aside loose soil.	7
10303	Wiggling Worms At Work	3	This creates tunnels.	8
10304	Wiggling Worms At Work	5	Air flows along these tunnels.	9
10305	Wiggling Worms At Work	3	Rainwater trickles down.	10
10306	Wiggling Worms At Work	4	Roots drink it up.	11
10307	Wiggling Worms At Work	6	Moist ground helps plants grow better.	12
10308	Wiggling Worms At Work	10	Worms tunnel in the hard packed soil by swallowing it.	13
10309	Wiggling Worms At Work	16	The soil goes in the worm’s mouth, slides into the crop, then passes down the gizzard.	14
10310	Wiggling Worms At Work	5	Worms do not have teeth.	15
10311	Wiggling Worms At Work	14	Muscles, fine grains of sand, and small stones in the gizzard grind the soil.	16
10312	Wiggling Worms At Work	17	Worms digest leaf and plant bits that are found in soil, just as you digest a salad.	17
10313	Wiggling Worms At Work	21	What's left passes through a worm's body and comes out its tail end in the Form of pellets, called worm castings.	18
10314	Wiggling Worms At Work	6	These castings make good plant food.	19
10315	Wiggling Worms At Work	9	They help fruits and vegetables grow bigger and better.	20
10316	Wiggling Worms At Work	6	Sometimes worms crawl above the ground.	21
10317	Wiggling Worms At Work	17	When they tunnel back down into the ground, they pull dead leaves and plants down with them.	22
10318	Wiggling Worms At Work	9	These plants make the soil better as they rot.	23
10319	Wiggling Worms At Work	4	Seeds come down, too.	24
10320	Wiggling Worms At Work	7	Some of these seeds send out roots.	25
10321	Wiggling Worms At Work	2	Seedlings sprout.	26
10322	Wiggling Worms At Work	7	Worms help new plants begin to grow.	27
10323	Wiggling Worms At Work	17	ms Worms can wiggle, twist, turn, and even tie themselves in knots because they have no backbones.	28
10324	Wiggling Worms At Work	10	Their soft bodies are made up of rings, or segments.	29
10325	Wiggling Worms At Work	10	These segments act like the coils on a Slinky toy.	30
10326	Wiggling Worms At Work	5	They let a worm bend.	31
10327	Wiggling Worms At Work	16	A worm has no legs, but eight bristles under each segment act a little like legs.	32
10328	Wiggling Worms At Work	5	They help a worm move.	33
10329	Wiggling Worms At Work	11	Strong muscles allow the worm to stretch out its Front end.	34
10330	Wiggling Worms At Work	5	It becomes long and thin.	35
10331	Wiggling Worms At Work	10	Then the worm Fastens its Front bristles to the soil.	36
10332	Wiggling Worms At Work	11	The back end slinks up, making the worm short and Fat.	37
10333	Wiggling Worms At Work	10	The worm wiggles along, Stretching and slinking, stretching and slinking.	38
10334	Wiggling Worms At Work	16	With all its wiggling twisting, and turning; it's a wonder a worm knows where it's headed.	39
10335	Wiggling Worms At Work	14	It has no eyes, no nose, no ears, and hardly any brain at all.	40
10336	Wiggling Worms At Work	7	But a worm knows what's happening nearby.	41
10337	Wiggling Worms At Work	11	It feels vibrations on the ground and senses a hungry robin.	42
10338	Wiggling Worms At Work	8	Quickly the worm slips back into its burrow.	43
10339	Wiggling Worms At Work	11	Hiding is the only way it can protect itself from enemies.	44
10340	Wiggling Worms At Work	6	Worms also hide from the sun.	45
10341	Wiggling Worms At Work	14	They must live in damp soil since they breath air through their moist skin.	46
10342	Wiggling Worms At Work	12	In the hot sun their skins dry up and they can’t breathe.	47
10343	Wiggling Worms At Work	9	Sometimes worms crawl to the surface, to find food.	48
10344	Wiggling Worms At Work	12	They select dead and decaying plants to drag back to their burrows.	49
10345	Wiggling Worms At Work	7	These plants contain bacteria that worms eat.	50
10346	Wiggling Worms At Work	4	Healthy plants do not.	51
10347	Wiggling Worms At Work	10	Worms pick leaves with pointed ends rather than round ones.	52
10348	Wiggling Worms At Work	4	No one knows why.	53
10349	Wiggling Worms At Work	6	Worms also eat fungi and mold.	54
10350	Wiggling Worms At Work	16	They slurp the hairlike :strands of mold the same way you might slurp strands of spaghetti.	55
10351	Wiggling Worms At Work	7	Worms eat at the entrance their burrows.	56
10352	Wiggling Worms At Work	10	Then each worm covers any leftover plants with its castings.	57
10353	Wiggling Worms At Work	9	This pile of worm castings is called a midden.	58
10354	Wiggling Worms At Work	20	It hides the top of the worm’s burrow, and acts like a door to keep out bad weather and rain.	59
10355	Wiggling Worms At Work	13	In spring, before the weather warms, worms wiggle to the surface to mate.	60
10356	Wiggling Worms At Work	7	Worms are different, from most other animals.	61
10357	Wiggling Worms At Work	7	Each worm is both male and female.	62
10358	Wiggling Worms At Work	7	But each one still needs a mate.	63
10359	Wiggling Worms At Work	9	After mating, each worm crawls back into its burrow.	64
10360	Wiggling Worms At Work	17	When the weather cools, a ringlike cocoon forms near the head of each worm that has mated.	65
10361	Wiggling Worms At Work	7	Slowly, the worm begins to move backward.	66
10362	Wiggling Worms At Work	17	The cocoon inches forward on the worm’s body just as a ring on your finger would move.	67
10363	Wiggling Worms At Work	9	The cocoon passes over openings in the worm’s body.	68
10364	Wiggling Worms At Work	13	Up to thirty eggs slip out of the openings and into the cocoon.	69
10365	Wiggling Worms At Work	26	In a few minutes the cocoon slips off the worm’s head, just as the ring would slip off your finger, The ends of the cocoon close.	70
10366	Wiggling Worms At Work	7	Inside the cocoon the eggs are fertilized.	71
10367	Wiggling Worms At Work	7	In about three weeks the eggs hatch.	72
10368	Wiggling Worms At Work	14	Out of about thirty eggs, only three or four wormlets emerge from each cocoon.	73
10369	Wiggling Worms At Work	13	They look like tiny pieces of cotton thread, less than an inch long.	74
10370	Wiggling Worms At Work	12	But they are fully developed worms and live completely on their own.	75
10371	Wiggling Worms At Work	7	They do not need their parents' help.	76
10372	Wiggling Worms At Work	23	The wormlets inch along, finding bits of dead plants to eat, dragging them to their tunnels, and covering any leftovers with their castings.	77
10373	Wiggling Worms At Work	9	They wiggle underground, loosening the soil and making tunnels.	78
10374	Wiggling Worms At Work	6	Even tiny wormlets help the soil.	79
10375	Wiggling Worms At Work	4	These babies grow fast.	80
10376	Wiggling Worms At Work	7	In six weeks they are adult worms.	81
10377	Wiggling Worms At Work	8	In winter, the soil near the surface freezes.	82
10378	Wiggling Worms At Work	12	The worms plug up their tunnels and move down to warmer soil.	83
10379	Wiggling Worms At Work	5	They stay there until spring.	84
10380	Wiggling Worms At Work	15	Then they wiggle up, tunnelling, twisting, and turning, until they're right under your feet again.	85
10381	Wiggling Worms At Work	5	Vegetables and flowers grow better.	86
10382	Wiggling Worms At Work	3	Trees grow bigger.	87
10383	Wiggling Worms At Work	12	Grass grows greener, because there are thousands of wiggling worms at work.	88
10384	Too Shy For Show And Tell	5	Sam was a quiet boy.	0
10385	Too Shy For Show And Tell	5	Nobody knew much about him.	1
10386	Too Shy For Show And Tell	11	Sam loved playing with lorries and cars, but nobody knew that.	2
10387	Too Shy For Show And Tell	10	Sam’s favourite food was chocolate cake, but nobody knew that.	3
10388	Too Shy For Show And Tell	15	Sam thought dogs were the best animals in the world, but nobody knew that, either.	4
10389	Too Shy For Show And Tell	14	The only thing that people knew about Sam was that he didn't talk much.	5
10390	Too Shy For Show And Tell	18	And Sam really didn't like talking in front of people, which is why Sam hated show and tell.	6
10391	Too Shy For Show And Tell	15	On Wednesday, Miss Ostrich told the class that show and tell would be on Friday.	7
10392	Too Shy For Show And Tell	6	Sam spent most of Thursday worrying.	8
10393	Too Shy For Show And Tell	15	He had a great thing to bring for show and tell, but he was scared.	9
10394	Too Shy For Show And Tell	8	On Friday, Sam didn’t get out of bed.	10
10395	Too Shy For Show And Tell	5	“My tummy hurts,” he lied.	11
10396	Too Shy For Show And Tell	13	“You’re fine, and you need to go to school today,” his mum said.	12
10397	Too Shy For Show And Tell	12	At school Sam told Miss Ostrich he'd forgotten about show and tell.	13
10398	Too Shy For Show And Tell	6	“I didn’t bring anything,” he said.	14
10399	Too Shy For Show And Tell	4	But that wasn’t true.	15
10400	Too Shy For Show And Tell	10	His perfect show and tell thing was in his rucksack.	16
10401	Too Shy For Show And Tell	5	“That’s okay,” Miss Ostrich said.	17
10402	Too Shy For Show And Tell	13	“You can just tell the class about the thing you left at home.”	18
10403	Too Shy For Show And Tell	3	Sam was terrified.	19
10404	Too Shy For Show And Tell	9	He didn't want to talk in front of everyone.	20
10405	Too Shy For Show And Tell	11	The thought of it made his tummy hurt really, really bad.	21
10406	Too Shy For Show And Tell	7	He imagined that he'd say something silly.	22
10407	Too Shy For Show And Tell	7	Or that he'd mess up his words.	23
10408	Too Shy For Show And Tell	4	Or that he'd faint.	24
10409	Too Shy For Show And Tell	4	Or that he’d cry.	25
10410	Too Shy For Show And Tell	11	Sam watched the other children show their show and tell things.	26
10411	Too Shy For Show And Tell	10	Helena showed a new doll she had for her birthday.	27
10412	Too Shy For Show And Tell	6	Everyone clapped when she had finished.	28
10413	Too Shy For Show And Tell	13	Alex showed a cool leaf that he found on the way to school.	29
10414	Too Shy For Show And Tell	18	"Alex said ""weaf"" instead of ""leaf,"" but nobody seemed to notice, and everyone clapped when he had finished."	30
10415	Too Shy For Show And Tell	5	Then it was Sam’s turn.	31
10416	Too Shy For Show And Tell	20	He took his perfect show and tell thing out of his rucksack and went to the front of the class.	32
10417	Too Shy For Show And Tell	9	"""What do you have to show us today, Sam?"""	33
10418	Too Shy For Show And Tell	6	Miss Ostrich asked with a smile.	34
10419	Too Shy For Show And Tell	5	Sam took a deep breath.	35
10420	Too Shy For Show And Tell	5	He looked at his classmates.	36
10421	Too Shy For Show And Tell	4	They were quietly waiting.	37
10422	Too Shy For Show And Tell	5	Sam held up his picture.	38
10423	Too Shy For Show And Tell	7	“This is my new dog,” he said.	39
10424	Too Shy For Show And Tell	18	“I named him Chocolate, because that’s my favourite kind of cake, and he’s the colour of chocolate cake.”	40
10425	Too Shy For Show And Tell	3	Sam didn't faint.	41
10426	Too Shy For Show And Tell	6	He didn't mess up his words.	42
10427	Too Shy For Show And Tell	3	He didn't cry.	43
10428	Too Shy For Show And Tell	4	And no one laughed.	44
10429	Too Shy For Show And Tell	7	Instead, everyone clapped when he had finished.	45
10430	Too Shy For Show And Tell	12	Now everyone in the class knew a little bit more about Sam.	46
10431	Too Shy For Show And Tell	10	Next time, he thought, I’ll bring my biggest fire engine.	47
10432	Too Shy For Show And Tell	3	And he did.	48

10532	All For One	2	he shouted.	45
10533	All For One	1	"""Quick!"""	46
10534	All For One	12	Marlon's mum found a scarf and sewed some curtain rings onto it.	47
10535	All For One	19	She made him an eye patch, and Marlon put on his striped T-shirt with a cutlass in his belt.	48
10536	All For One	4	"""Brilliant!"" said his mum."	49
10537	All For One	6	Marlon raced back to the others.	50
10538	All For One	3	"""Here I am!"""	51
10539	All For One	2	he said.	52
10540	All For One	7	But the others weren't pirates any more.	53
10541	All For One	10	They were doing handstands and swinging on the climbing frame.	54
10542	All For One	7	"""What are you doing now?"" asked Marlon."	55
10543	All For One	7	"""We're having a gymnastic contest,"" said Basher."	56

10545	All For One	3	Marlon gave up.	58
10546	All For One	13	He wasn't very good at gymnastic contests, especially ones with Basher in them.	59
10547	All For One	15	"T X ""What's the matter, love?"" asked Marlon's mum as he mooched into the kitchen."	60
10548	All For One	16	"""They keep changing the game,"" said Marlon - ""Can we fill up the new paddling pool?"""	61

10556	All For One	6	"""Go and get your swimming things."""	69
10557	All For One	8	"""You spoil that little monster,"" muttered Marlon's granny."	70
10558	All For One	30	While Marlon changed into his swimming things, his mum fixed the garden hose to the kitchen tap and filled the pool until it began to steam in the cold air.	71
10559	All For One	6	Marlon's granny watched from the window.	72
10560	All For One	5	"""This is ridiculous” she said."	73
10561	All For One	11	"""In my day we just sat quietly and read a book."""	74

10566	All For One	11	"""We don't want him starving as well as freezing,"" she said."	79
10567	All For One	18	Then it began to rain, so Marlon's mum fixed up an umbrella to stop the cake going soggy.	80
10568	All For One	12	On their way home, Alligatina, Boomps-a-daisy and Basher looked over the wall.	81
10569	All For One	6	"""What a cool pool,"" said Alligatina."	82
10570	All For One	3	"""It's really big."""	83
10571	All For One	10	"""We could all get in there with you,"" said Boomps-a-daisy."	84

10575	All For One	6	"""Can we come and play tomorrow?"""	88
10576	All For One	10	Marlon leaned back and took a sip of orange juice.	89

10775	Little by Little	5	All your friends can swim.	13
10776	Little by Little	2	Whatever next?’	14
10777	Little by Little	21	Obviously being kind to otters is not on Bear and Beaver’s Can-do list Mummy said crossly, when Scramble told her. '	15
10778	Little by Little	10	And I bet their sandcastles are rubbish, muttered Scramble’s sister.	16
10779	Little by Little	21	Sometimes, Scramble would pretend lie could swim, but really lie was hopping — very, very quickly — along the river bed.	17
10780	Little by Little	26	Other times, he would run along the river bank, trying not to be left behind by his friends as they spun and tumbled through the water.	18
10781	Little by Little	31	But most days, Scramble would simply sit on his favourite slippery rock, wishing and wishing — from his whiskers all the way down to his toes — that he could swim.	19
10782	Little by Little	14	Every day, his mummy would say, 'Today’s the day you’re going to crack it.’	20
10783	Little by Little	5	And every day it wasn’t.	21
10784	Little by Little	22	Then, one sunny Monday, Scramble and his sister were watching their friends jumping off the Highest-Ever Rock into the Deepest-Ever Pool below.	22
10785	Little by Little	9	'You have got to start small,’ his sister said.	23
10786	Little by Little	3	'Small?’ said Scramble.	24
10787	Little by Little	4	'Yes, small,’ she said.	25
10788	Little by Little	10	'Come on, today really is the day to start small.	26
10789	Little by Little	10	Believe it, little brother, starting small turns can’t-do into can-do.’	27
10790	Little by Little	7	So, on that Monday, Scramble started small.	28
10791	Little by Little	18	He hopped along the river bed, keeping his toes off the bottom just that bit longer every time.	29
10792	Little by Little	13	On Tuesday, he did higher hops and floating (with holding on) in between.	30
10793	Little by Little	9	On Wednesday, Scramble did floating with no holding on.	31
10794	Little by Little	18	And, on Thursday, he did a little kicking and then a lot of kicking to the Halfway Stone.	32
10795	Little by Little	25	On Friday, Scramble splashed and kicked and swam the whole width of the river — from one bank to the other — all by himself.	33
10796	Little by Little	23	And very soon (over Saturday and Sunday really), that width became the length of the river from Scramble’s rock to the Deepest-Ever Pool.	34
10797	Little by Little	18	Then the splashing and kicking turned into gliding, and the roly-polies on the river bank became underwater tumbling.	35
10798	Little by Little	22	And, on Sunday evening, as all his friends and family gathered along the river bank to cheer him on . . .	36
10799	Little by Little	11	Scramble jumped off the Highest- Ever Rock into the Deepest-Ever Pool.	37
10800	Little by Little	8	'I did it,’ said Scramble to his sister.	38
10801	Little by Little	4	'I can really swim!’	39
10802	Little by Little	13	You really can laughed his sister, hugging her very wet little brother. '	40
10803	Little by Little	2	You see.	41
10804	Little by Little	5	You started small. . .	42
10805	Little by Little	3	and finished big!’	43
10806	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	19	Once there was a little girl called Sophie, and she was having tea with her mummy in the kitchen.	0
10807	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	8	Suddenly there was a ring at the door.	1
10808	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	12	Sophie opened the door, and there was a big, furry, stripy tiger.	2
10809	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	9	The tiger said, “Excuse me, but I’m very hungry.	3
10810	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	9	Do you think I could have tea with you?”	4
10811	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	7	Sophie’s mummy said, “Of course, come in.”	5
10812	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	13	So the tiger came into the kitchen and sat down at the table.	6
10813	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	8	Sophie’s mummy said, “Would you like a sandwich?”	7
10814	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	8	But the tiger didn’t just take one sandwich.	8
10815	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	15	He took all the sandwiches on the plate and swallowed them in one big mouthful.	9
10816	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	1	Owp!	10
10817	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	11	And he still looked hungry, so Sophie passed him the buns.	11
10818	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	9	But again the tiger didn’t eat just one bun.	12
10819	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	8	He ate all the buns on the dish.	13
10820	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	21	And then he ate all the biscuits and all the cake, until there was nothing left to eat on the table.	14
10821	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	9	So Sophie’s mummy said, “Would you like a drink?”	15
10822	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	18	And the tiger drank all the milk in the milk jug and all the tea in the teapot.	16
10823	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	14	And then he looked round the kitchen to see what else he could find.	17
10824	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	13	He ate all the supper that was cooking in the saucepans... .. .and	18
10825	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	8	all the food in the fridge, .. .and	19
10826	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	9	all the packets and tins in the cupboard... ..	20
10827	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	22	.and he drank all the milk, and all the orange juice, and all Daddy’s beer, and all the water in the tap.	21
10828	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	9	Then he said, “Thank you for my nice tea.	22
10829	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	6	I think I’d better go now.”	23
10830	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	3	And he went.	24
10831	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	9	Sophie’s mummy said, “I don’t know what to do.	25
10832	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	12	I’ve got nothing for Daddy’s supper, the tiger has eaten it all.”	26
10833	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	19	And Sophie found she couldn’t have her bath because the tiger had drunk all the water in the tap.	27
10834	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	6	Just then Sophie’s daddy came home.	28
10835	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	24	So Sophie and her mummy told him what had happened, and how the tiger had eaten all the food and drunk all the drink.	29
10836	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	9	And Sophie’s daddy said, “I know what we’ll do.	30
10837	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	6	I’ve got a very good idea.	31
10838	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	10	We’ll put on our coats and go to a cafe.”	32
10839	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	31	So they went out in the dark, and all the street lamps were lit, and all the cars had their lights on, and they walked down the road to a cafe.	33
10840	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	13	And they had a lovely supper with sausages and chips and ice cream.	34
10841	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	17	In the morning Sophie and her mummy went shopping and they bought lots more things to eat.	35
10842	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	20	And they also bought a very big tin of Tiger Food, in case the tiger should come to tea again.	36
10843	The Tiger Who Came To Tea	4	But he never did.	37

10860	Stick Man	4	“I’m not a Pooh-stick!	16
10861	Stick Man	15	Why can’t they see, I’m Stick Man, I’m Stick Man, I’M STICK MAN, that’s me.	17

10863	Stick Man	4	Stick Man is floating.	19
10864	Stick Man	5	He floats on and on.	20
10865	Stick Man	9	Stick Man, oh Stick Man, beware of the swan!	21
10866	Stick Man	5	“A twig!” says the swan.	22
10867	Stick Man	5	“This twig is the best!	23
10868	Stick Man	11	It’s the right kind of twig to weave into my nest.”	24
10869	Stick Man	4	“I’m not a twig!	25
10870	Stick Man	25	Why can’t they see, I’m Stick Man, I'm Stick Man, I'M STICK MAN, that’s me, And I long to he back in the family tree.”	26
10871	Stick Man	9	The nest is deserted, and Stick Man is free.	27
10872	Stick Man	10	He drifts down the river and sails out to sea!	28
10873	Stick Man	17	He tosses and turns, till the frolicking foam Washes him up on a beach far from home.	29
10874	Stick Man	10	Here comes a dad with a spade in his hand.	30
10875	Stick Man	9	Stick Man, oh Stick Man; beware of the sand!	31
10876	Stick Man	5	“A mast!” yells the dad.	32
10877	Stick Man	3	“An excellent mast!	33
10878	Stick Man	1	"""Hooray!"	34
10879	Stick Man	8	There’s a flag on our castle at last.’	35

10892	Stick Man	9	“Will I ever get back to the family tree?”	48
10893	Stick Man	8	Stick Man is lonely, Stick Man is lost.	49
10894	Stick Man	8	Stick Man is frozen and covered in frost.	50
10895	Stick Man	4	Stick Man is weary.	51
10896	Stick Man	5	His eyes start to close.	52
10897	Stick Man	10	He stretches and yawns and lies down for a doze.	53
10898	Stick Man	12	He can’t hear the bells, or the sweet-singing choir . . .	54
10899	Stick Man	11	Or the voice saying, “Here’s a good stick for the fire.	55
10900	Stick Man	8	Stick Man is lying asleep in the grate.	56
10901	Stick Man	8	Can anyone wake him before it’s too late?	57
10902	Stick Man	13	He dreams of his kids and his Stick Lady Love, Then suddenly wakes.	58
10903	Stick Man	5	What's that noise up above?	59
10904	Stick Man	15	"It starts as a chuckle, then turns to a shout: ""Oh-ho-ho ho-ho . . ."	60
10905	Stick Man	2	I’m STUCK!	61
10906	Stick Man	3	Gel me OUT!”	62
10907	Stick Man	3	A Stuck Man?	63
10908	Stick Man	3	A Stuck Man?	64
10909	Stick Man	5	Now who could that be?	65
10910	Stick Man	2	“Don’t worry!”	66
10911	Stick Man	3	cries Stick Man.	67
10912	Stick Man	5	“I’ll soon set you free.”	68
10913	Stick Man	10	A scratch and a scrape and a flurry of soot.	69
10914	Stick Man	10	A wiggle, a jiggle, and — out pokes a foot!	70
10915	Stick Man	13	A shove and a nudge, a hop and a jump . . .	71
10916	Stick Man	9	And Santa falls into the room with a thump!	72
10917	Stick Man	8	“Stick Man, oh Stick Man, you excellent friend'.	73

10919	Stick Man	3	Thanks a million!	75
10920	Stick Man	3	Thanks without end!”	76
10921	Stick Man	14	Then Stick Man helps Santa deliver the toys To fast-asleep girls . . .	77
10922	Stick Man	4	and to fast-asleep boys.	78
10923	Stick Man	2	Faster and.	79
10924	Stick Man	14	faster they fly through the snow, Till Santa says, “Only one chimney to go!”	80
10925	Stick Man	3	Stick Lady’s lonely.	81
10926	Stick Man	4	The children are sad.	82
10927	Stick Man	9	It won’t feel like Christmas without their Stick Dad.	83
10928	Stick Man	9	They toss and they turn in the family bed.	84
10929	Stick Man	7	But what is that clattering sound overhead?	85
10930	Stick Man	6	Someone is tumbling into their house.	86
10931	Stick Man	10	Is it a bird, or a bat, or a mouse?	87
10932	Stick Man	6	Or could it . . .	88
10933	Stick Man	9	yes, could it just possibly be . . .	89
10934	Stick Man	11	“I'm Stick Man, I’m Stick Man, I’M STICK MAN, that’s me!	90
10935	Stick Man	9	And I’m sticking right here in the family tree.”	91
10936	When Granny Saved Christmas	1	“Yippeeee!	0
10937	When Granny Saved Christmas	5	It’s nearly Christmas!” sang Bubble.	1
10938	When Granny Saved Christmas	15	“And we’re going to Granny’s!” added Squeak as he helped Mummy pack his snowflake pyjamas.	2
10939	When Granny Saved Christmas	9	“Hurry up then,” smiled Mummy, “it’s a long drive!”	3
10940	When Granny Saved Christmas	14	“I wish we could fly to Granny’s,” sighed Bubble, “like Santa in his sleigh.”	4
10941	When Granny Saved Christmas	3	“Oh no, Bubble!”	5
10942	When Granny Saved Christmas	2	Squeak cried.	6
10943	When Granny Saved Christmas	7	“How will Santa know we’re at Granny’s?	7
10944	When Granny Saved Christmas	4	He might come here!”	8
10945	When Granny Saved Christmas	3	“Easy-peasy!” said Bubble.	9
10946	When Granny Saved Christmas	3	“We’ll tell him!”	10
10947	When Granny Saved Christmas	4	“We’ll scooter to Lapland.”	11
10948	When Granny Saved Christmas	12	“Pogo over the penguins, and hitch a ride to the North Pole!”	12
10949	When Granny Saved Christmas	10	“Wow, have we got time for all that?” said Mummy.	13
10950	When Granny Saved Christmas	6	“How about writing Santa a letter?”	14
10951	When Granny Saved Christmas	9	“Clever Mummy!” said Squeak as they got to work.	15
10952	When Granny Saved Christmas	5	“Let’s make it really BIG!”	16
10953	When Granny Saved Christmas	6	“So Santa sees it!” agreed Bubble.	17
10954	When Granny Saved Christmas	13	With snowy sparkles and glittery glue, they made the most magnificent letter ever.	18
10955	When Granny Saved Christmas	21	“I wrote Santa’s address HUGE, to make sure it gets there,” Bubble told Squeak as Daddy helped them post the letter.	19
10956	When Granny Saved Christmas	11	But just as it plopped through the slot, Squeak cried, “Bubble!	20
10957	When Granny Saved Christmas	7	We forgot to tell Santa Granny’s address.	21
10958	When Granny Saved Christmas	7	How will he know where to go?”	22
10959	When Granny Saved Christmas	4	'I know!’ said Bubble.	23
10960	When Granny Saved Christmas	14	“We’ll bake a bazillion carroty cookies… and leave a trail for Rudolph to follow!”	24
10961	When Granny Saved Christmas	2	“Sounds yummy!’	25
10962	When Granny Saved Christmas	6	said Daddy, as they whizzed home.	26
10963	When Granny Saved Christmas	6	“But Granny’s waiting to see us.	27
10964	When Granny Saved Christmas	7	Could we just leave Santa a map?”	28
10965	When Granny Saved Christmas	4	‘Clever Daddy!” said Squeak.	29
10966	When Granny Saved Christmas	13	Together they helped Daddy draw a map, and pin it to the door.	30
10967	When Granny Saved Christmas	7	Then they helped Mummy pack the car.	31
10968	When Granny Saved Christmas	1	"""Hooray!"	32
10969	When Granny Saved Christmas	4	We’re off to Granny’s!”	33
10970	When Granny Saved Christmas	8	everyone cheered, as they squashed the boot shut.	34
10971	When Granny Saved Christmas	7	On the way they counted Christmas trees.	35
10972	When Granny Saved Christmas	3	“I’ve seen two!	36
10973	When Granny Saved Christmas	4	Six! Twenty!” yelled Bubble.	37
10974	When Granny Saved Christmas	5	“I’ve seen eighty-numpty-nine!” cried Squeak.	38
10975	When Granny Saved Christmas	4	“That’s not a number!”	39
10976	When Granny Saved Christmas	2	Bubble giggled.	40
10977	When Granny Saved Christmas	10	“It is, IT IS - isn’t it, Daddy?” shouted Squeak.	41
10978	When Granny Saved Christmas	7	“Are we nearly there yet?” sighed Daddy.	42
10979	When Granny Saved Christmas	11	At last they saw Granny s house sparkling in the snow.	43
10980	When Granny Saved Christmas	10	“Grannyyyy!” yelled Bubble and Squeak, jumping into a big Granny-hug.	44
10981	When Granny Saved Christmas	4	“My favourite little mice!”	45
10982	When Granny Saved Christmas	2	she beamed.	46
10983	When Granny Saved Christmas	4	Then, Bubble suddenly stopped.	47
10984	When Granny Saved Christmas	2	"“OH NO!"""	48
10985	When Granny Saved Christmas	7	he gasped, staring at Granny s roof.	49
10986	When Granny Saved Christmas	6	“Granny, where’s your chimney?” cried Bubble.	50
10987	When Granny Saved Christmas	5	“There isn’t one!” squeaked Squeak.	51
10988	When Granny Saved Christmas	5	“How will Santa get in?”	52
10989	When Granny Saved Christmas	3	they both wailed.	53
10990	When Granny Saved Christmas	4	“Don’t worry,” smiled Granny.	54
10991	When Granny Saved Christmas	10	“I’ve been very busy while I was waiting for you.”	55
10992	When Granny Saved Christmas	8	Bubble and Squeak followed Granny into her garden.	56
10993	When Granny Saved Christmas	3	“Wow!” they gasped.	57
10994	When Granny Saved Christmas	5	“It’s my Super-swishy-Santa-Slide!” said Granny.	58
10995	When Granny Saved Christmas	4	“Clever Granny!” cheered Squeak.	59
10996	When Granny Saved Christmas	8	“Santa’s sure to find us now!” cried Bubble.	60
10997	When Granny Saved Christmas	20	The little mice swooped and swished down Santa’s Slide until the stars began to twinkle, and Granny called, “Cocoa- time!”	61
10998	When Granny Saved Christmas	16	After cocoa and kisses, they wriggled into their pyjamas, and Granny read them a bedtime story.	62
10999	When Granny Saved Christmas	17	“Thanks for making sure Santa finds us, Bubble,” yawned Squeak as the pair snuggled down to sleep.	63
11000	When Granny Saved Christmas	8	“I hope he brings you a lovely present.”	64
11001	When Granny Saved Christmas	5	And guess what... . ..	65
11002	When Granny Saved Christmas	2	Santa did!	66
11003	After the Storm	6	Percy the park-keeper couldn't sle ep.	0
11004	After the Storm	16	Outside his hut a great storm was raging, with t hunder and lightning and pouring rain.	1
11005	After the Storm	21	Percy wasn’t frightened by the thunder and he loved to watch the lightning as it lit up the whol e park.	2
11006	After the Storm	6	He didn't even mind the rain.	3
11007	After the Storm	10	But there w as one thing that Percy didn't like.	4
11008	After the Storm	5	He didn’t like the wind.	5
11009	After the Storm	14	It blew down fences in the park and ripped branch es off the trees.	6
11010	After the Storm	6	He didn’t like it one bit.	7
11011	After the Storm	10	“Oh dear,” he sighed as he watched from his window.	8
11012	After the Storm	11	The wind tugged at the trees, making them creak and groan.	9
11013	After the Storm	10	“It loo ks like I’m going to be busy tomorrow.”	10
11014	After the Storm	14	He pulled his pillo w over his head and tried to get to sleep.	11
11015	After the Storm	7	Percy was up early in the morning.	12
11016	After the Storm	10	The w ind had stopped and the sky was clear.	13
11017	After the Storm	21	Percy loaded up his wheelbarrow with all the things he would need to make repairs and clear up after the storm.	14
11018	After the Storm	8	Then he set off to inspect the damage.	15
11019	After the Storm	14	He felt happy as he took deep brea ths of the fresh, clean air.	16
11020	After the Storm	8	P erhaps the damage wouldn't be too bad.	17
11021	After the Storm	4	But he was wrong.	18
11022	After the Storm	4	Something dreadful had happened.	19
11023	After the Storm	23	A great big oak tree that had stood by itself on top of a little hill had been blown over by the storm.	20
11024	After the Storm	9	The giant tree had been one of Percy’s favourites.	21
11025	After the Storm	20	Now it looked very sad lying on its side with its mass of tangly roots sticking up into tire air.	22
11026	After the Storm	16	But it wasn’t just one of Percy’s favourite trees; some of Percy’s animal friends lived there.	23
11027	After the Storm	5	Now their homes were wrecked.	24
11028	After the Storm	7	Percy hurried up to the fallen tree.	25
11029	After the Storm	12	The animals were gathered by the tree looki ng cross and unhappy.	26
11030	After the Storm	10	When they saw Percy everyone st arted talking at once.	27
11031	After the Storm	21	Percy sat down with his friends and liste ned as they told how the storm had brought down the great tree.	28
11032	After the Storm	10	“And now we have nowhere to live,” said the badger.	29

11065	After the Storm	10	“Let’s paddle across to the other side of the lake.	62
11066	After the Storm	4	I have an idea.”	63
11067	After the Storm	4	The animals looked puzzled.	64
11068	After the Storm	5	What was Percy up to?	65
11069	After the Storm	9	Slowly they paddled the wheelbar row across the lake.	66

11386	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	10	Once there were two bears, Big Bear and Little Bear.	0
11387	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	14	- Big Bear is the big hear, and Little Bear is the little bear.	1
11388	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	8	They played all day in the bright sunlight.	2
11389	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	31	When night came, arid the sun went down, Big Bear took Little Beat home to the Bear Big Bear put Little Bear to bed in the dark part of the cave.	3
11390	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	7	“Go to sleep, Little Bear,” he said.	4
11391	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	4	And Little Bear tried.	5
11392	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	18	Big Bear settled in the Bear Chair and read his Bear Book, by the light of the fire.	6
11393	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	7	But Little Bear couldn’t get to sleep.	7
11394	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	27	“Can’t you sleep, Little Bear?” asked Big Bear, putting down his Bear Book (which was just getting to the interesting part) and padding over to the bed.	8
11395	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	5	“I’m scared,” said Little Bear.	9
11396	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	9	“Why are you scared, Little Bear?” asked Big Bear.	10
11397	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	8	“I don’t like the dark,” said Little Bear.	11
11398	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	5	“What dark?” said Big Bear.	12
11399	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	8	“The dark all around us,” said Little Bear.	13
11400	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	32	Big Bear looked, and he saw that the dark part of the cave was very dark, so he went to the Lantern Cupboard and took out the tiniest lantern that was there.	14
11401	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	14	Big Bear lit the tiniest lantern, and put it near to Little Bear’s bed.	15
11402	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	14	“There’s a tiny light to stop you being scared, Little Bear,” said Big Bear.	16
11403	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	12	“Thank you, Big Bear,” said Little Bear, cuddling up in the glow.	17
11404	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	31	“Now go to sleep, Little Bear,” said Big Bear, and he padded back to the Bear Chair and settled down to read the Bear Book, by the light of the fire.	18
11405	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	10	Little Bear tried to go to sleep, but he couldn’t.	19
11406	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	29	“Can’t you sleep, Little Bear?” yawned Big Bear, putting down his Bear Book (with just four pages to go to the interesting bit) and padding over to the bed.	20
11407	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	5	“I’m scared,” said Little Bear.	21
11408	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	9	“Why are you scared, Little Bear?” asked Big Bear.	22
11409	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	8	“I don’t like the dark,” said Little Bear.	23
11410	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	5	“What dark?” asked Big Bear.	24
11411	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	8	“The dark all around us,” said Little Bear.	25
11412	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	9	“But I brought you a lantern!” said Big Bear.	26
11413	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	7	“Only a tiny-weeny one,” said Little Bear.	27
11414	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	5	“And there’s lots of dark!”	28
11415	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	18	Big Bear looked, and he saw that Little Bear was quite right, there was still lots of dark.	29
11416	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	14	So Big Bear went to the Lantern Cupboard and took out a bigger lantern.	30
11417	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	43	Big Bear lit the lantern, and put it beside the other one “Now go to sleep, Little Bear,” said Big Bear and he padded back to the Bear Chair and settled down to read the Bear Book, by the light of the fire.	31
11418	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	12	Little Bear tried and tried to go to sleep, but he couldn’t.	32
11419	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	25	“Can’t you sleep, Little Bear?” grunted Big Bear, putting down his Bear Book (with just three pages to go) and padding over to the bed.	33
11420	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	5	“I’m scared,” said Little Bear.	34
11421	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	9	“Why are you scared, Little Bear?” asked Big Bear.	35
11422	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	8	“I don’t like the dark,” said Little Bear.	36
11423	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	5	“What dark?” asked Big Bear.	37
11424	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	8	“The dark all around us,” said Little Bear.	38
11425	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	9	“But I brought you two lanterns!” said Big Bear.	39
11426	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	7	“A tiny one and a bigger one!”	40
11427	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	6	“Not much bigger,” said Little Bear.	41
11428	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	6	“And there’s still lots of dark.”	42
11429	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	30	Big Bear thought about it, and then he went to the Lantern Cupboard and took out the Biggest Lantern of Them All, with two handles and a bit of chain.	43
11430	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	9	He hooked the lantern up above Little Bear’s bed.	44
11431	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	9	“I’ve brought you the Biggest Lantern of Them All!”	45
11432	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	4	he told Little Bear.	46
11433	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	6	“That’s to stop you being scared!”	47
11434	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	17	“Thank you, Big Bear,” said Little Bear, curling up in the glow and watching the shadows dance.	48
11435	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	31	“Now go to sleep, Little Bear,” said Big Bear and he padded back to the Bear Chair and settled down to read the Bear Book, by the light of the fire.	49
11436	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	14	Little Bear tried and tried and tried to go to sleep, but he couldn’t.	50
11437	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	25	“Can’t you sleep, Little Bear?” groaned Big Bear, putting down his Bear Book (with just two pages to go) and padding over to the bed.	51
11438	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	5	“I’m scared,” said Little Bear.	52
11439	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	9	“Why are you scared, Little Bear?” asked Big Bear.	53
11440	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	8	“I don’t like the dark,” said Little Bear.	54
11441	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	5	“What dark?” asked Big Bear.	55
11442	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	8	“The dark all around us,” said Little Bear.	56
11443	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	19	“But I brought you the Biggest Lantern of Them All and there isn’t any dark left,” said Big Bear.	57
11444	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	6	“Yes, there is!” said Little Bear.	58
11445	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	4	“There is, out there!”	59
11446	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	11	And he pointed out of the Bear Cave, at the night.	60
11447	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	8	Big Bear saw that Little Bear was right.	61
11448	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	5	Big Bear was very puzzled.	62
11449	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	12	All the lanterns in the world couldn’t light up the dark outside.	63
11450	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	17	Big Bear thought about it for a long time, and then he said, “Come on, Little Bear.”	64
11451	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	7	“Where are we going?” asked Little Bear.	65
11452	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	4	“Out!” said Big Bear.	66
11453	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	7	“Out into the darkness?” said Little Bear.	67
11454	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	4	“Yes!” said Big Bear.	68
11455	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	9	“But I’m scared of the dark!” said Little Bear.	69
11456	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	30	“No need to be!” said Big Bear, and he took Little Bear by the paw and led him out from the cave into the night and it was ... DARK!	70
11457	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	1	“Ooooh!	71
11458	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	10	I’m scared,” said Little Bear, cuddling up to Big Bear.	72
11459	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	16	Big Bear lifted Little Bear, and cuddled him, and said, “Look at the dark, Little Bear.”	73
11460	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	5	And Little, Bear looked .	74
11461	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	10	“I’ve brought you the moon, Little Bear,” said Big Bear.	75
11462	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	9	“The bright yellow moon, and all the twinkly stars.”	76
11463	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	19	But Little Bear didn’t say anything, for he had gone to sleep, warm and safe in Big Bear’s arms.	77
11464	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	37	Big Bear carried Little Bear back into the Bear Cave, fast asleep, and he settled down with Little Bear on one arm and the Bear Book on the other, cosy in the Bear Chair by the fire.	78
11465	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	10	And Big Bear read the Bear Book right to ...	79
11466	Can't You Sleep Little Bear	2	THE END	80
11467	The Duchess and Guy	20	Once upon a time a happy-go-lucky beagle named Guy found himself without a family, or a place to call home.	0
11468	The Duchess and Guy	14	He blinked his puppy dog eyes and wished that someone would take him home.	1
11469	The Duchess and Guy	9	But he didn’t have much luck . . .	2
11470	The Duchess and Guy	8	until he spotted Meghan and her pup, Bogart.	3
11471	The Duchess and Guy	17	From the tip of his nose down to his toes, Guy knew they would be a family.	4
11472	The Duchess and Guy	21	Guy couldn’t believe how lucky he was to have found Meghan, but Meghan always told Guy she was the lucky one.	5
11473	The Duchess and Guy	18	One day, Meghan met her own match when she fen in love with a British prince named Harry.	6
11474	The Duchess and Guy	8	Guy gave his paw of approval to Harry.	7
11475	The Duchess and Guy	11	He treated Meghan like the princess Guy always knew she was.	8
11476	The Duchess and Guy	17	Soon, Meghan told Guy that they were going to move to a new forever home in England.	9
11477	The Duchess and Guy	13	Guy couldn’t wait to prove that he was a regal beagle at heart.	10
11478	The Duchess and Guy	14	For his grand entrance, he showed off his new dog trick: take a bow.	11
11479	The Duchess and Guy	22	But the crown jewels the Queen wore dazzled him and he forgot which end should be up and which should be down.	12
11480	The Duchess and Guy	7	Guy tucked his head into his paws.	13
11481	The Duchess and Guy	9	He wasn’t prim and proper like the Royal Family.	14
11482	The Duchess and Guy	13	He and Bogart used to stir up all kinds of mischief back home.	15
11483	The Duchess and Guy	24	As fun as their adventures were, Guy knew he would have to start behaving if he was going to fit in at the palace.	16
11484	The Duchess and Guy	9	Could Guy help Lupo round up the royal children?	17
11485	The Duchess and Guy	18	Guy tried to keep the successors in line, but instead he decorated the nursery with muddy paw prints.	18
11486	The Duchess and Guy	13	Could Guy run in a pack with the Queen’s dorgis, Vulcan and Candy?	19
11487	The Duchess and Guy	29	Guy tried to perk his ears up and get low enough to parade with their pack, but he didn’t like how the dorgis were always bossing the humans around.	20
11488	The Duchess and Guy	6	Could Guy join the Queen’s Guard?	21
11489	The Duchess and Guy	12	Guy tried to act tough, but the furry hat made him sneeze.	22
11490	The Duchess and Guy	9	Finally, Guy thought he’d found his place serving tea.	23
11491	The Duchess and Guy	7	He turned on his adorable beagle charm.	24
11492	The Duchess and Guy	7	But his tail spun out of control.	25
11493	The Duchess and Guy	1	Swish!	26
11494	The Duchess and Guy	1	Crash!	27
11495	The Duchess and Guy	1	Smash!	28
11496	The Duchess and Guy	5	The Queen was not impressed.	29
11497	The Duchess and Guy	10	Guy’s ears drooped and the wag disappeared from his tail.	30
11498	The Duchess and Guy	12	Every pup needs a purpose, but Guy couldn’t seem to find his.	31
11499	The Duchess and Guy	8	Even worse, Guy feared he had disappointed Meghan.	32
11500	The Duchess and Guy	15	Before Guy could woof an apology, Meghan gave him an encouraging scratch behind his ear.	33
11501	The Duchess and Guy	13	“I wasn’t sure I’d ever fit in here, either,” Meghan told her pup.	34
11502	The Duchess and Guy	15	“But if you just be yourself, you’ll be part of the family in no time.”	35
11503	The Duchess and Guy	8	Guy gave Meghan a big, sloppy beagle kiss.	36
11504	The Duchess and Guy	5	Guy held his tail high.	37
11505	The Duchess and Guy	10	He knew just how to impress his new family now.	38
11506	The Duchess and Guy	11	He would show them all of his and Bogart’s old tricks!	39
11507	The Duchess and Guy	9	One day, Guy spotted the Queen outside the palace.	40
11508	The Duchess and Guy	30	He still felt nervous around her, but when Guy looked the Queen in the eyes, he realized she had the same sad look that Guy got when he missed Bogart.	41
11509	The Duchess and Guy	15	Before the Queen could turn away, Guy jumped into her car and sat beside her.	42
11510	The Duchess and Guy	26	The beagle had waited for love before and now he’d wait until the Queen was ready to let him heal that dog-shaped hole in her heart.	43
11511	The Duchess and Guy	9	Finally, Guy felt at home with his new family.	44
11512	The Duchess and Guy	27	He never dreamt that his life would turn out this way back when he was wandering the streets homeless, trying to look like he belonged to someone.	45
11513	The Duchess and Guy	13	Without a doubt, Guy knew he was the luckiest dog in the world.	46
11514	The Duchess and Guy	7	And together, they lived happily ever after.	47
11515	Grandad's Island	16	At the bottom of Syd’s garden, through the gate and past the tree, was Grandad’s house.	0
11516	Grandad's Island	18	There was a key under a flowerpot and Syd could let himself in any time that he liked.	1
11517	Grandad's Island	8	One day Syd called round to see Grandad.	2
11518	Grandad's Island	9	But he wasn’t in any of the usual places.	3
11519	Grandad's Island	12	Then, just as he was about to leave, Syd heard Grandad calling.	4
11520	Grandad's Island	6	“Ah, there you are!” said Grandad.	5
11521	Grandad's Island	7	“There’s something I want you to see.”	6
11522	Grandad's Island	6	Syd carefully climbed up the ladder.	7
11523	Grandad's Island	8	He had never been in Grandad’s attic before.	8
11524	Grandad's Island	37	It was full of old boxes and things that Grandad had collected from around the world At the far end of the attic, Grandad pulled a sheet down from the wall to reveal a big metal door.	9
11525	Grandad's Island	5	“After you, Syd,” he said.	10
11526	Grandad's Island	14	Syd turned the handle - CLUNK - and gave the heavy door a push.	11
11527	Grandad's Island	12	Syd found himself standing on the deck of a very tall ship.	12
11528	Grandad's Island	8	There was an ocean of rooftops all around.	13
11529	Grandad's Island	4	Grandad pulled a handle.	14
11530	Grandad's Island	9	BOOOOOOOOP! went the horn and the ship lurched forward.	15
11531	Grandad's Island	4	“Steady as she goes!”	16
11532	Grandad's Island	2	Grandad boomed.	17
11533	Grandad's Island	19	Grandad was very good at steering the ship and kept them on a smooth course across the rolling waves.	18
11534	Grandad's Island	22	Mile after mile all they saw was sea and sky, sky and sea - until, at last, something appeared on the horizon.	19
11535	Grandad's Island	4	“LAND AHOY!” shouted Syd.	20
11536	Grandad's Island	12	They dropped the ship’s anchor and made their way to the shore.	21
11537	Grandad's Island	6	“Grandad, don’t you want your stick?”	22
11538	Grandad's Island	2	Syd asked.	23
11539	Grandad's Island	9	“No, I think I’ll be all right,” said Grandad.	24
11540	Grandad's Island	11	In the thick jungle of the island, it was very hot.	25
11541	Grandad's Island	11	“We must find a good spot for a shelter,” said Grandad.	26
11542	Grandad's Island	19	At the top of the island, where a cool breeze blew through the trees, they found an old shack.	27
11543	Grandad's Island	16	There was a lot to do, but with a little help, they soon had everything shipshape.	28
11544	Grandad's Island	7	They explored the island high and low.	29
11545	Grandad's Island	7	At every turn they saw new wonders.	30
11546	Grandad's Island	6	It was the most perfect place.	31
11547	Grandad's Island	6	Syd wished they could stay forever.	32
11548	Grandad's Island	13	But he knew that it would soon be time for them to leave.	33
11549	Grandad's Island	11	“Syd, there’s something I’ve been meaning to tell you,” said Grandad.	34
11550	Grandad's Island	4	“You see ... ...	35
11551	Grandad's Island	4	I’m thinking of staying.”	36
11552	Grandad's Island	3	“Oh,” said Syd.	37
11553	Grandad's Island	5	“But won’t you be lonely?”	38
11554	Grandad's Island	10	“No... no, I don’t think I will,” said Grandad smiling.	39
11555	Grandad's Island	10	Before he set sail, Syd hugged Grandad one last time.	40
11556	Grandad's Island	6	He would miss him very much.	41
11557	Grandad's Island	5	Everyone came to wave goodbye.	42
11558	Grandad's Island	8	Across the waves, the ship chugged and churned.	43
11559	Grandad's Island	7	The journey seemed much longer without Grandad.	44
11560	Grandad's Island	7	But Syd steered the ship safely home.	45
11561	Grandad's Island	11	The next morning, Syd went back round to Grandad s house.	46
11562	Grandad's Island	10	It was just the same as it had always been.	47
11563	Grandad's Island	6	Except Grandad wasn’t there any more.	48
11564	Grandad's Island	7	In the attic it was very quiet.	49
11565	Grandad's Island	18	The big metal door wasn’t there - it was as if it had never been there at all.	50
11566	Grandad's Island	8	Then Syd heard something tapping at the window.	51
11567	Grandad's Island	6	He wondered what it might be.	52
11568	Grandad's Island	8	There on the window ledge, was an envelope.	53
11569	Grandad's Island	5	Syd carefully prised it open.	54
11570	Harry and the Robots	11	It was a shock for Harry when his robot fell over.	0
11571	Harry and the Robots	13	It was just doing a nice march and suddenly its lights went out.	1
11572	Harry and the Robots	14	Harry heard Nan coughing in the yard, so he ran out to show her.	2
11573	Harry and the Robots	10	Some of the robot’s batteries had leaked onto its wires.	3
11574	Harry and the Robots	21	They put him in a parcel and sent him to the robot hospital “They’ll know how to mend him,” Nan said.	4
11575	Harry and the Robots	19	Harry wanted to make another robot to play with while he waited for his marching robot to come back.	5
11576	Harry and the Robots	4	Nan said, “Good idea.	6
11577	Harry and the Robots	8	We’ll use my best scissors if you like.”	7
11578	Harry and the Robots	8	They laid the things ready on the table.	8
11579	Harry and the Robots	5	But they never got started.	9
11580	Harry and the Robots	11	Mum made Nan go to bed, her cough was so bad.	10
11581	Harry and the Robots	11	When Harry woke up the next morning, there was no Nan	11
11582	Harry and the Robots	7	The ambulance had come in the night.	12
11583	Harry and the Robots	12	She had to go into hospital, Mum said, for her bad chest.	13
11584	Harry and the Robots	7	That day, Sam watched TV a lot.	14
11585	Harry and the Robots	8	Harry started making a robot all by himself.	15
11586	Harry and the Robots	7	He wanted to use Nan’s best scissors.	16
11587	Harry and the Robots	5	Nan had said he could.	17
11588	Harry and the Robots	4	But Sam said, “No!	18
11589	Harry and the Robots	3	Those are Nan’s!”	19
11590	Harry and the Robots	9	That was why Harry threw his Stegosaurus at her.	20
11591	Harry and the Robots	6	Mum took him to settle down.	21
11592	Harry and the Robots	19	She said he could use Nan’s best scissors if Nan had said so, but only while she was watching.	22
11593	Harry and the Robots	11	He had to be very careful though, because they were sharp.	23
11594	Harry and the Robots	13	Harry worked hard all morning ... ... until there was a new robot.	24
11595	Harry and the Robots	3	A special one.	25
11596	Harry and the Robots	4	Harry taught it marching.	26
11597	Harry and the Robots	4	He taught it talking.	27
11598	Harry and the Robots	8	But most of all he taught it blasting.	28
11599	Harry and the Robots	9	The robot said, “Ha - Lo Har - Ree.	29
11600	Harry and the Robots	8	Have - you - got - a cough?	30
11601	Harry and the Robots	1	BLAAAST!”	31
11602	Harry and the Robots	10	The hospital was big but they found Nan in there.	32
11603	Harry and the Robots	11	Mum said Sam and Harry had to wait outside Nan’s room.	33
11604	Harry and the Robots	12	They waved through the window but Nan did not open her eyes.	34
11605	Harry and the Robots	7	Sam and Mum whispered with the doctor.	35
11606	Harry and the Robots	13	So Harry slipped into the room - just him and the special robot.	36
11607	Harry and the Robots	7	He put the special robot by Nan.	37
11608	Harry and the Robots	8	The robot said, “Ha - Lo - Nan.	38
11609	Harry and the Robots	9	Have - you - got - a - cough?”	39
11610	Harry and the Robots	4	She opened one eye.	40
11611	Harry and the Robots	2	It winked.	41
11612	Harry and the Robots	12	The robot said, “I - will - blast - your - cough.	42
11613	Harry and the Robots	1	BLAAAST!”	43
11614	Harry and the Robots	9	That was when Mum ran in saying - “Harry!	44
11615	Harry and the Robots	1	No!”	45
11616	Harry and the Robots	10	But the doctor said not to worry, it was fine.	46
11617	Harry and the Robots	9	A robot would be a nice helper for Nan.	47
11618	Harry and the Robots	6	That evening, Harry was very busy.	48
11619	Harry and the Robots	6	He joined ... he stuck ...	49
11620	Harry and the Robots	3	he painted and...	50
11621	Harry and the Robots	10	Harry made five more special robots to look after Nan.	51
11622	Harry and the Robots	4	The robots guarded Nan.	52
11623	Harry and the Robots	4	They marched for her.	53
11624	Harry and the Robots	4	They blasted her cough.	54
11625	Harry and the Robots	5	And soon she was better.	55
11626	Harry and the Robots	7	Nan came home and unpacked her things.	56
11627	Harry and the Robots	6	“You’re a good looker-afterer,” she whispered.	57
11628	Harry and the Robots	6	“And my special robots,” said Harry.	58
11629	Harry and the Robots	6	“Oh yes, them too,” said Nan.	59
11630	Harry and the Robots	10	“I’d like to keep them by me, do you mind?”	60
11631	Harry and the Robots	6	Harry did not mind at all.	61
11632	Harry and the Robots	14	Nan went out into the yard to see how the chickens were getting on.	62
11633	Harry and the Robots	4	They were just fine.	63
11634	Harry and the Robots	5	That afternoon a parcel arrived.	64
11635	Harry and the Robots	10	It was the marching robot, back from the robot hospital.	65
11636	Harry and the Robots	14	His light went on and he did a nice march - good as new.	66

11685	Where's My Cuddle	7	Jake said goodbye at the school door.	0
11686	Where's My Cuddle	7	“Come and have a cuddle,” said Mum.	1
11687	Where's My Cuddle	3	“MUM!” said Jake.	2
11688	Where's My Cuddle	5	“I don’t want a cuddle.	3
11689	Where's My Cuddle	6	Everyone will think I’m a baby.”	4
11690	Where's My Cuddle	6	And Jake ran off to play.	5
11691	Where's My Cuddle	13	But at the end of the day, things hadn’t all gone Jake’s way.	6
11692	Where's My Cuddle	9	And he was heard to say, “Where’s my cuddle?”	7
11693	Where's My Cuddle	14	"""You said you didn’t want it, so I gave it to Dad,” said Mum."	8
11694	Where's My Cuddle	8	So Jake said to Dad, “Where’s my cuddle?”	9
11695	Where's My Cuddle	8	“I gave it to the cat,” said Dad.	10
11696	Where's My Cuddle	5	Jake went to the cat.	11
11697	Where's My Cuddle	5	“Where’s my cuddle?” he said.	12
11698	Where's My Cuddle	15	“I gave it to a witch,” she said, “because she gave me a nice fish.”	13
11699	Where's My Cuddle	10	Jake went to the witch and said, “Where’s my cuddle?”	14
11700	Where's My Cuddle	14	“I’ve given it to a wizard” said the witch, “because his spell went wrong.”	15
11701	Where's My Cuddle	6	So Jake went to the wizard.	16
11702	Where's My Cuddle	5	“Where’s my cuddle?” he said.	17
11703	Where's My Cuddle	4	“Goodness!” said the wizard.	18
11704	Where's My Cuddle	15	“I gave it to a knight in armour who was off to see a dragon.”	19
11705	Where's My Cuddle	4	Jake found the knight.	20
11706	Where's My Cuddle	5	“Where’s my cuddle?” said Jake.	21
11707	Where's My Cuddle	9	“I gave it to the princess,” said the knight.	22
11708	Where's My Cuddle	6	Jake went over to the princess.	23
11709	Where's My Cuddle	3	“Where’s my cuddle?”	24
11710	Where's My Cuddle	25	It was a good cuddle and it made me brave, said the princess, “so I gave it to the dragon and tamed him with it.”	25
11711	Where's My Cuddle	9	Jake said to the dragon, “Give me my cuddle!”	26
11712	Where's My Cuddle	8	“That’s no way to ask,” said the dragon.	27
11713	Where's My Cuddle	8	“Can I have my cuddle, PLEASE?” said Jake.	28
11714	Where's My Cuddle	7	And the dragon gave him a cuddle.	29
11715	Where's My Cuddle	17	Jake rode home with the knight and the princess and the dragon, just in time for tea.	30
11716	Where's My Cuddle	15	And after tea Mum put him to bed and said, “Now where’s MY cuddle, please?”	31
11717	Where's My Cuddle	8	“Well,” said Jake, “I want to keep it!”	32
11718	Where's My Cuddle	11	“What if I give you another one?” said Mum, cuddling Jake.	33
11719	Where's My Cuddle	8	“Then I’ll give you this one,” said Jake.	34
11720	Where's My Cuddle	8	“But be careful who you give it to.”	35
11721	Jesus' Christmas Party	13	There was nothing the innkeepe r liked more than a good night's sleep.	0
11722	Jesus' Christmas Party	26	But that n ight there was a knock at the door: “No room,” said the innkeeper “But we're tired and have travelled through night and day.”	1
11723	Jesus' Christmas Party	7	“There’s only the stable round the back.	2
11724	Jesus' Christmas Party	3	Here's two blankets.	3
11725	Jesus' Christmas Party	4	Sign the registe r.”	4
11726	Jesus' Christmas Party	7	So they signed it: 'Mary and Joseph.'	5
11727	Jesus' Christmas Party	16	Then he shut the door; climbed the stairs, got in to bed, and went to sleep.	6
11728	Jesus' Christmas Party	11	But then, later; the re was another knock at the door.	7
11729	Jesus' Christmas Party	2	“Excuse me.	8
11730	Jesus' Christmas Party	10	I wonder if you could lend us another smaller blanket?”	9
11731	Jesus' Christmas Party	1	“There.	10
11732	Jesus' Christmas Party	7	On e smaller blanket,” said the innkeeper.	11
11733	Jesus' Christmas Party	16	Then he shut the door; climbed the stairs, got in to bed, and went to sleep.	12
11734	Jesus' Christmas Party	8	But then a bright light woke him up.	13
11735	Jesus' Christmas Party	26	“That’s all I need,” said the innkeeper Then he shut the door; climbed the stairs, drew the cur tains, got into bed, and went to sleep.	14
11736	Jesus' Christmas Party	13	But then there was another knock at the door “We are three shepherds.”	15
11737	Jesus' Christmas Party	4	“Well, what’s the matter?	16
11738	Jesus' Christmas Party	3	Lost your sheep?”	17
11739	Jesus' Christmas Party	7	“We've come to see Mary and Joseph.”	18
11740	Jesus' Christmas Party	6	“ROUND THE BACK,” said the innkeeper.	19
11741	Jesus' Christmas Party	16	Then he shut the door; climbed the stairs, got in to bed, and went to sleep.	20
11742	Jesus' Christmas Party	10	But then there was yet another knock at the door.	21
11743	Jesus' Christmas Party	4	“We are three kings.	22
11744	Jesus' Christmas Party	6	"We've come —"" “ROUND THE BACK!”"	23
11745	Jesus' Christmas Party	15	He slammed the door; climbed the stairs, got into be d, and went to sleep.	24
11746	Jesus' Christmas Party	9	But then a chorus of singing woke him up.	25
11747	Jesus' Christmas Party	5	“RIGHT – THAT DOES IT!”	26
11748	Jesus' Christmas Party	38	So he got out of bed, stomped down the stairs, threw open the door; went round the back, stormed into th e stable, and was just about to speak when — “Ssshh!” whispered everybody, “you'll wake the baby!”	27
11749	Jesus' Christmas Party	4	“Baby?” said the innkeeper.	28
11750	Jesus' Christmas Party	8	“Yes, a baby has this night been born.”	29
11751	Jesus' Christmas Party	10	“Oh?” said th e innkeeper, looking crossly into the manger.	30
11752	Jesus' Christmas Party	14	And just at that moment, suddenly, amazingly, his anger seemed t o fly away.	31
11753	Jesus' Christmas Party	7	“Oh,” said the innkeeper; “isn't he lovely!”	32
11754	Jesus' Christmas Party	30	In fact, he thought he was so special so that they could come and he woke up all the guests at the inn, have a look at the baby too.	33
11755	Jesus' Christmas Party	8	So no one got much sleep that night!	34
11756	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	4	Ellen had chicken pox.	0
11757	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	5	She was covered in spots.	1
11758	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	6	“You mustn’t scratch them!” said Mum.	2
11759	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	23	Ellen put on her right slipper (she had lost the left one) and went to look at her spots in the bathroom mirror.	3
11760	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	8	The spot on her nose was so itchy!	4
11761	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	9	Surely a tiny little scratch wouldn’t do any harm?	5
11762	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	7	Ellen lifted a finger to her nose...	6
11763	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	12	Then she jumped, when a voice from the mirror said, “Don’t scratch!	7
11764	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	6	You might turn into a toad!”	8
11765	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	5	Could this really be happening?	9
11766	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	8	Could Ellen’s reflection really be talking to her?	10
11767	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	15	Before Ellen could reply, the mirror girl went on: “You’ve got really bad dragon pox.”	11
11768	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	5	“No I haven’t,” said Ellen.	12
11769	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	4	“I’ve got chicken pox.	13
11770	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	4	And so have you.	14
11771	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	3	You’re my reflection.”	15
11772	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	25	“Don’t be silly,” said the mirror girl, and the next second she had jumped out of the mirror and was in the bathroom with Ellen.	16
11773	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	3	“I’m Princess Mirror-Belle.	17
11774	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	14	You really ought to curtsey, but as you’re my friend I’ll let you off.”	18
11775	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	7	“Are you really a princess?” asked Ellen.	19
11776	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	6	“But you look just like me.	20
11777	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	5	You’ve got the same pyjamas.	21
11778	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	9	You’ve even lost one of your slippers like me.”	22
11779	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	6	"“Oh no I haven’t,"" said Mirror-Belle."	23
11780	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	15	She paused for a second and then continued: “My slipper was stolen by a goblin.	24
11781	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	4	They’re always stealing slippers.	25
11782	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	6	They like to sleep in them.”	26
11783	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	2	Ellen laughed.	27
11784	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	7	“Do they have little sheets and pillows?”	28
11785	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	2	she asked.	29
11786	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	5	“Never mind that,” said Mirror-Belle.	30
11787	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	11	"“We need to get started on the cure for dragon pox."""	31
11788	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	13	And she put the plug in the bath and turned on the taps.	32
11789	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	8	"“But I haven’t got dragon pox,"" said Ellen."	33
11790	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	6	"“Well, I have,"" Mirror-Belle said firmly."	34
11791	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	16	“You see, a dragon captured me last week and carried me off to his mountain lair.	35
11792	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	19	Luckily a knight came and rescued me, but when I got home I came out in these terrible spots.”	36
11793	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	9	"“Did the knight want to marry you?"" asked Ellen."	37
11794	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	7	But Mirror-Belle seemed not to hear her.	38
11795	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	4	"“Now then,"" said Mirror-Belle."	39
11796	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	4	“On with the cure!	40
11797	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	4	This stuff looks good.”	41
11798	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	13	She grabbed a bottle of bubble bath and squirted it into the water.	42
11799	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	3	"Then, “How odd!"""	43
11800	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	7	she exclaimed, as hundreds of bubbles appeared.	44
11801	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	9	"“Don’t you have bubble bath back home?"" asked Ellen."	45
11802	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	4	"“Certainly not,"" said Mirror-Belle."	46
11803	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	6	“But we do have bubble fish.	47
11804	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	3	They’re much better.	48
11805	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	11	"They swim about in the bath and blow thousands of bubbles."""	49
11806	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	13	“But isn’t the bath water a bit hot for the fish?” asked Ellen.	50
11807	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	5	“Never mind that,” said Mirror-Belle.	51
11808	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	3	“Let’s get in.”	52
11809	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	15	“Hmm, we need some more ingredients,” said Mirror-Belle when they were both in the bath.	53
11810	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	3	"“Let’s try this."""	54
11811	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	16	Before Ellen could stop her, she had squirted a whole tube of toothpaste into the water.	55
11812	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	12	"“Hey, now we won’t be able to clean our teeth,"" Ellen protested."	56
11813	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	12	"“But can’t you get the fairies to clean your teeth?"" asked Mirror-Belle."	57
11814	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	7	“No - I don’t know any fairies.	58
11815	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	8	"And what would they use instead of toothpaste?"""	59
11816	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	14	"“Well, our fairies collect dewdrops from rose petals and use that,"" said Mirror- Belle."	60
11817	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	9	"“How does it stick on the toothbrushes?"" asked Ellen."	61
11818	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	11	“I do wish you wouldn’t ask so many questions,” said Mirror-Belle.	62
11819	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	6	“Let’s get on with the cure.	63
11820	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	3	How about this?”	64
11821	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	11	And she squirted in some white foam from a spray can.	65
11822	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	3	“Stop!” cried Ellen.	66
11823	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	5	"“That’s my dad’s shaving cream."""	67
11824	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	14	"“Well, I think he should stop shaving, like my father the King,"" said Mirror-Belle."	68
11825	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	9	"“Does your father have a beard then?"" asked Ellen."	69
11826	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	4	“Of course he does.	70
11827	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	7	It’s so long it reaches the ground.	71
11828	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	12	He needs two servants to walk ahead of him to carry it.	72
11829	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	8	And sometimes birds make their nests in it.”	73
11830	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	2	Ellen laughed.	74
11831	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	13	“And do the birds fly in and out feeding worms to their babies?”	75
11832	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	2	she asked.	76
11833	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	3	Mirror-Belle didn’t reply.	77
11834	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	10	Instead, she poured a bottle of shampoo into the bath.	78
11835	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	9	“How will we wash our hair now?” asked Ellen.	79
11836	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	7	“I wouldn’t bother washing it,” said Mirror-Belle.	80
11837	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	17	“When my hair gets dirty I just say a magic spell and wish for some different hair.	81
11838	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	9	My hair doesn’t always look like yours, you know.	82
11839	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	16	Last week I had golden curls and the week before I had ... er, red ringlets.”	83
11840	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	7	“I’d love to do that,” said Ellen.	84
11841	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	5	“What is the magic spell?”	85
11842	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	18	“I’ll tell you later,” said Mirror-Belle, and she splashed some frothy creamy foamy toothpasty bath water at Ellen.	86
11843	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	6	Ellen giggled and splashed some back.	87
11844	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	6	This was beginning to be fun.	88
11845	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	16	But then she noticed that the bathroom floor was getting really wet from all the splashing.	89
11846	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	11	"“Oh dear, my mum will be a bit cross,"" she said."	90
11847	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	1	“Really?	91
11848	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	2	How peculiar.	92
11849	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	12	My mother the Queen is cross if I don’t splash the floor.	93
11850	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	19	In fact she likes me to splash it so much that the whole bathroom is like a paddling pool.	94
11851	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	17	Then she paddles about in it to wash her feet, and so do all the palace maids.”	95
11852	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	11	"“Doesn’t the water drip down onto the floor below?"" asked Ellen."	96
11853	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	11	"“I thought I told you to stop asking questions,"" said Mirror-Belle."	97
11854	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	12	"“Now, it’s time to get dry and put our pyjamas back on."""	98
11855	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	14	I “But we’re still all spotty,” said Ellen as she put on her slipper.	99
11856	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	4	“The cure hasn’t worked.”	100
11857	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	11	"“Ah, that’s because we haven’t done part two yet,"" said Mirror-Belle."	101
11858	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	5	"“What’s part two?"" asked Ellen."	102
11859	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	1	“This!”	103
11860	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	19	Mirror-Belle picked up a roll of loo paper and started to wind it round and round Ellen, who laughed.	104
11861	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	5	"“What about you?"" she asked."	105
11862	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	9	“We’ll do me later,” said Mirror-Belle, carrying on winding.	106
11863	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	18	Before long Ellen’s whole body was covered * in loo paper and Mirror-Belle had started on her face.	107
11864	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	9	"Then, “Close your eyes and count to a hundred!"""	108
11865	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	2	she said.	109
11866	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	4	So Ellen did. .	110
11867	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	3	98, 99, loo!”	111
11868	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	11	Ellen ripped the paper off her face and opened her eyes.	112
11869	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	4	“Where are you, Mirror-Belle?”	113
11870	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	2	she asked.	114
11871	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	14	She looked around the empty room and saw that the door handle was turning.	115
11872	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	4	But it wasn’t Mirror-Belle.	116
11873	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	7	Instead, Ellen’s mum came into the room.	117
11874	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	6	“Ellen, what have you been doing?”	118
11875	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	17	she said, as she looked at the watery foamy room and all the empty tubes and bottles.	119
11876	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	9	“It wasn’t me, it was Princess Mirror-Belle,” said Ellen.	120
11877	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	6	“She came out of the mirror.	121
11878	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	9	She was trying to cure my dragon pox ...	122
11879	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	4	I mean, chicken pox.”	123
11880	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	14	“Oh, and I suppose she’s gone back into the mirror now?” said Ellen’s mum.	124
11881	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	8	Ellen looked at the mirror over the basin.	125
11882	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	6	It was covered in toothpasty bubbles.	126
11883	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	7	"“Yes, I think she has,"" she said."	127
11884	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	3	Ellen’s mum sighed.	128
11885	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	5	Then she looked at Ellen.	129
11886	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	11	"“Actually, your spots do look quite a bit better,"" she said."	130
11887	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	7	“That one on your nose has disappeared.	131
11888	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	2	"And look!"""	132
11889	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	8	she added, picking something out of the basin.	133
11890	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	4	"“Here’s your left slipper."""	134
11891	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	12	Ellen said nothing, but she smiled as she put the slipper on.	135
11892	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	8	She knew that it wasn’t really her slipper.	136
11893	Princess Mirror-Belle And The Dragon Pox	5	It belonged to Princess Mirror-Belle.	137

12021	The Ugly Duckling	14	Once upon a time there was a mother duck, who had seven little ducklings.	0
12022	The Ugly Duckling	12	Six of them were soft and fluffy and yellow, and said, “Quack.”	1
12023	The Ugly Duckling	6	The seventh duckling was quite different.	2
12024	The Ugly Duckling	15	He was grey and spiky and had a long neck, and could only say, “Honk.”	3
12025	The Ugly Duckling	6	The other ducklings called him ‘ugly’.	4
12026	The Ugly Duckling	14	He tried hard to be liked, but the other ducklings never played with him.	5
12027	The Ugly Duckling	6	His mother would shake her head.	6
12028	The Ugly Duckling	1	“Quack.	7
12029	The Ugly Duckling	6	Are you sure you are mine?”	8
12030	The Ugly Duckling	2	she said.	9
12031	The Ugly Duckling	7	“Quack, you’re a funny sort of duck.”	10
12032	The Ugly Duckling	17	One day they all swam over to visit the ducks on the other side of the river.	11
12033	The Ugly Duckling	8	The ugly duckling, as always, followed far behind.	12
12034	The Ugly Duckling	9	The other big ducks hissed and pecked at him.	13
12035	The Ugly Duckling	4	“Go away,” they quacked.	14
12036	The Ugly Duckling	10	“We don’t like you; you’re not much of a duck.”	15
12037	The Ugly Duckling	10	But “Honk,” was all the sad little duckling could say.	16
12038	The Ugly Duckling	21	That night as the other ducks slept, the ugly duckling swam far away and hid in some reeds by a pond.	17
12039	The Ugly Duckling	7	“Honk, no one wants me,” he sniffed.	18
12040	The Ugly Duckling	13	An old cat came prowling along, “Miaow, what sort of bird are you?”	19
12041	The Ugly Duckling	2	she asked.	20
12042	The Ugly Duckling	8	“I’m a duckling, honk,” replied the ugly duckling.	21
12043	The Ugly Duckling	17	“Mmmm, miaow, funny sort of duck,” said the cat, and she crept off to hunt for mice.	22
12044	The Ugly Duckling	15	The weather grew colder, but the ugly duckling stayed all alone by the little pond.	23
12045	The Ugly Duckling	15	One bright day, he saw some beautiful white birds with long necks, flying high overhead.	24
12046	The Ugly Duckling	10	“Honk,' he called out to them, “where are you going?”	25
12047	The Ugly Duckling	9	“Far away south, where it’s warm,” they called back.	26
12048	The Ugly Duckling	4	“Come fly with us.”	27
12049	The Ugly Duckling	7	The ugly duckling skittered across the water.	28
12050	The Ugly Duckling	3	“Wait for me!”	29
12051	The Ugly Duckling	2	he honked.	30
12052	The Ugly Duckling	16	But he wasn’t ready to fly yet, and the white birds flew on far far away.	31
12053	The Ugly Duckling	4	Befdre long winter came.	32
12054	The Ugly Duckling	9	Snow fell and there was ice on the pond.	33
12055	The Ugly Duckling	13	The ugly duckling had no mother to snuggle up against and keep warm.	34
12056	The Ugly Duckling	8	“Honk,” he said to himself, “I’m so unhappy.”	35
12057	The Ugly Duckling	21	Then one bright morning he woke up to find the snow and ice had melted, and the world was green again.	36
12058	The Ugly Duckling	6	Feeling strong, he tried his wings.	37
12059	The Ugly Duckling	19	They had grown through the winter, and he soared up easily from the pond into the clear blue sky.	38
12060	The Ugly Duckling	5	“Honk,” he cried in excitement.	39
12061	The Ugly Duckling	2	“Honk, honk!”	40
12062	The Ugly Duckling	17	He flew on over the land, following the shape of the big river in the spring sunshine.	41
12063	The Ugly Duckling	11	Soon the days grew longer and warmer, for summer had come.	42
12064	The Ugly Duckling	9	One day he saw the beautiful white birds again.	43
12065	The Ugly Duckling	13	The ugly duckling flew down and landed near them on the shimmering water.	44
12066	The Ugly Duckling	2	.... _	45
12067	The Ugly Duckling	5	“Honk,” said the beautiful birds.	46
12068	The Ugly Duckling	7	“Hello, come and swim with us here.	47
12069	The Ugly Duckling	13	There’s plenty to eat,” and they plunged their long necks into the water.	48
12070	The Ugly Duckling	7	“Honk, who me?” said the ugly duckling.	49
12071	The Ugly Duckling	3	“Swim with you?	50
12072	The Ugly Duckling	10	But I’m just an ugly duckling; no one wants me.”	51
12073	The Ugly Duckling	4	r j,w J M	52
12074	The Ugly Duckling	5	The white birds all laughed.	53
12075	The Ugly Duckling	12	“You’re not ugly, and you’re not a duckling at all,” they said.	54
12076	The Ugly Duckling	8	“You are a young swan, just like us.	55
12077	The Ugly Duckling	10	Look at yourself in the water... and you will see.”	56
12078	The Ugly Duckling	13	The ugly duckling looked down into the water and saw his own reflection.	57
12079	The Ugly Duckling	21	His feathers were now a brilliant white all over, he had a long neck, and a bright gold and black beak.	58
12080	The Ugly Duckling	8	He was a swan just like the others.	59
12081	The Ugly Duckling	11	He honked happily, it didn’t matter now that he couldn’t quack.	60
12082	The Ugly Duckling	5	The swans gathered around him.	61
12083	The Ugly Duckling	3	“Welcome,” they said.	62
12084	The Ugly Duckling	27	So the once ugly duckling, who had grown into a beautiful swan, flew away with the other swans over the blue water, and lived happily ever after.	63
12085	The Ugly Duckling	2	“Honk, honk!”	64
12086	Room on the Broom	20	The witch had a cat and a very tall hat, And long ginger hair which she wore in a plait.	0
12087	Room on the Broom	20	How the cat purred and how the witch grinned, As they sat on their broomstick and flew through the wind.	1
12088	Room on the Broom	21	But how the witch wailed and how the cat spat, When the wind blew so wildly it blew off the hat.	2
12089	Room on the Broom	10	“Down!” cried the witch, and they flew to the ground.	3
12090	Room on the Broom	11	They searched for the hat but no hat could be found.	4
12091	Room on the Broom	18	Then out of the bushes on thundering paws There bounded a dog with the hat in his jaws.	5
12092	Room on the Broom	27	He dropped it politely, then eagerly said (As the witch pulled the hat firmly down on her head), “I am a dog, as keen as can be.	6
12093	Room on the Broom	11	Is there room on the broom for a dog like me?”	7
12094	Room on the Broom	9	“Yes!” cried the witch, and the dog clambered on.	8
12095	Room on the Broom	7	The witch tapped the broomstick and whoosh!	9
12096	Room on the Broom	3	they were gone.	10
12097	Room on the Broom	8	Over the fields and the forests they flew.	11
12098	Room on the Broom	10	The dog wagged his tail and the stormy wind blew.	12
12099	Room on the Broom	19	The witch laughed aloud and held onto her hat, But away blew the bow from her long ginger plait!	13
12100	Room on the Broom	20	Then out from a tree, with an ear-splitting shriek, There flapped a green bird with the bow in her beak.	14
12101	Room on the Broom	19	She dropped it politely and bent her head low, Down! cried the witch, and they flew to the ground.	15
12102	Room on the Broom	11	They searched for the bow but no bow could be found.	16
12103	Room on the Broom	20	Then said (as the witch tied her plait in a bow), “I am a bird, as green as can be.	17
12104	Room on the Broom	11	Is there room on the broom for a bird like me?”	18
12105	Room on the Broom	9	“Yes!” cried the witch, so the bird fluttered on.	19
12106	Room on the Broom	7	The witch tapped the broomstick and whoosh!	20
12107	Room on the Broom	3	they were gone.	21
12108	Room on the Broom	8	Over the reeds and the rivers they flew.	22
12109	Room on the Broom	10	The bird shrieked with glee and the stormy wind blew.	23
12110	Room on the Broom	10	They shot through the sky to the back of beyond.	24
12111	Room on the Broom	11	The witch clutched her bow but let go of her wand.	25
12112	Room on the Broom	10	“Down!” cried the witch, and they flew to the ground.	26
12113	Room on the Broom	11	They searched for the wand but no wand could be found.	27
12114	Room on the Broom	20	Then all of a sudden from out of a pond Leapt a dripping wet frog with a dripping wet wand.	28
12115	Room on the Broom	30	He dropped it politely, then said with a croak (As the witch dried the wand on a fold of her cloak), “I am a frog, as clean as can be.	29
12116	Room on the Broom	11	Is there room on the broom for a frog like me?”	30
12117	Room on the Broom	9	“Yes!” said the witch, so the frog bounded on.	31
12118	Room on the Broom	7	The witch tapped the broomstick and whoosh!	32
12119	Room on the Broom	3	they were gone.	33
12120	Room on the Broom	8	Over the moors and the mountains they flew.	34
12121	Room on the Broom	9	The frog jumped for joy and . . .	35
12122	Room on the Broom	2	f ...	36
12123	Room on the Broom	5	THE BROOM SNAPPED IN TWO!	37
12124	Room on the Broom	10	Down fell the cat and the dog and the frog.	38
12125	Room on the Broom	7	Down they went tumbling into a bog.	39
12126	Room on the Broom	21	The witch’s half-broomstick flew into a cloud, And the witch heard a roar that was scary and loud . . .	40
12127	Room on the Broom	22	< 3 “I am a dragon, as mean as can be, And I’m planning to have WITCH AND CHIPS for my tea!”	41
12128	Room on the Broom	8	“No!” cried the witch, flying higher and higher.	42
12129	Room on the Broom	8	The dragon flew after her, breathing out fire.	43
12130	Room on the Broom	9	“Help!” cried the witch, flying down to the ground.	44
12131	Room on the Broom	10	She looked all around but no help could be found.	45
12132	Room on the Broom	17	The dragon drew nearer and, licking his lips, Said, “Maybe this once I’ll have witch without chips.”	46
12133	Room on the Broom	19	But just as he planned to begin on his feast, From out of a ditch rose a horrible beast.	47
12134	Room on the Broom	10	It was tall, dark and sticky, and feathered and furred.	48
12135	Room on the Broom	11	It had four frightful heads, it had wings like a bird.	49
12136	Room on the Broom	21	And its terrible voice, when it started to speak, Was a yowl and a growl and a croak and a shriek.	50
12137	Room on the Broom	19	It dripped and it squelched as it strode from the ditch, And it said to the dragon, “Buzz off!	51
12138	Room on the Broom	2	— THAT’S	52
12139	Room on the Broom	2	MY WITCH!”	53
12140	Room on the Broom	9	The dragon drew back and he started to shake.	54
12141	Room on the Broom	2	“I’m sorry!”	55
12142	Room on the Broom	2	he spluttered.	56
12143	Room on the Broom	4	“I made a mistake.	57
12144	Room on the Broom	11	It’s nice to have met you, but now I must fly.”	58
12145	Room on the Broom	12	And he spread out his wings and was off through the sky.	59
12146	Room on the Broom	10	Then down flew the bird and down jumped the frog.	60
12147	Room on the Broom	9	Down climbed the cat, and “Phew!” said the dog.	61
12148	Room on the Broom	6	And, “Thank you, oh, thank you!”	62
12149	Room on the Broom	4	the grateful witch cried.	63
12150	Room on the Broom	8	“Without you I’d be in that dragon’s inside.”	64
12151	Room on the Broom	17	Then she filled up her cauldron and said with a grin, “Find something, everyone, throw something in!”	65
12152	Room on the Broom	22	So the frog found a lily, the cat found a cone, The bird found a twig and the dog found a bone.	66
12153	Room on the Broom	20	They threw them all in and the witch stirred them well, And while she was stirring she muttered a spell.	67
12154	Room on the Broom	4	“Ziggety, ziggety, zaggety, ZOOM!”	68
12155	Room on the Broom	7	Then out rose . . . ...	69
12156	Room on the Broom	4	A TRULY MAGNIFICENT BROOM!	70
12157	Room on the Broom	22	With seats for the witch and the cat and the dog, A nest for the bird and a shower for the frog.	71
12158	Room on the Broom	9	“Yes!” cried the witch, and they all clambered on.	72
12159	Room on the Broom	7	The witch tapped the broomstick and whoosh!	73
12160	Room on the Broom	3	they were gone.	74
12161	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	8	Nan thought the attic needed a clear out.	0
12162	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	4	She let Harry help.	1
12163	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	9	Harry found an old box all grey with dust.	2
12164	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	5	He lifted the lid ...	3
12165	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	6	DINOSAURS Harry took the dinosaurs downstairs.	4
12166	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	5	He unbent the bent ones.	5
12167	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	6	He fixed all the broken ones.	6
12168	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	12	He got up on a chair and washed them in the sink.	7
12169	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	14	Nan came to see and say, “Just what do you think you’re up to?”	8
12170	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	6	“Dinosaurs don’t like boxes,” Harry said.	9
12171	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	7	“They want to be in a bucket.”	10
12172	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	6	Sam came in from watching TV.	11
12173	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	10	She said it was stupid, fussing over so much junk.	12
12174	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	5	“Dinosaurs aren't junk,” Harry said.	13
12175	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	10	The next day, Harry went to the library with Mum.	14
12176	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	7	He took the dinosaurs in their bucket.	15
12177	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	15	He found out all the names in a book and told them to the dinosaurs.	16
12178	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	6	He spoke softly to each one.	17
12179	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	6	He whispered, “You are my Scelidosaurus.”	18
12180	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	4	“You are my Stegosaurus.”	19
12181	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	4	“You are my Triceratops.”	20
12182	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	13	And there were enough names for all the Apatosauruses and Anchisauruses and Tyrannosauruses.	21
12183	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	6	The dinosaurs said, “Thank you, Harry.”	22
12184	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	13	They said it very quietly, but just loud enough for Harry to hear.	23
12185	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	9	After that, the dinosaurs went everywhere in Harry’s bucket.	24
12186	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	3	They went shopping.	25
12187	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	6	They went to the garden centre.	26
12188	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	5	They went to the beach.	27
12189	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	10	When Harry had a bath, the dinosaurs had a bath.	28
12190	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	10	When Harry went to bed, the dinosaurs went to bed.	29
12191	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	5	Sometimes they got left behind.	30
12192	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	13	But they never got lost for long because Harry knew all their names.	31
12193	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	14	And he always called put their names, just to make sure they were safe.	32
12194	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	9	One day, Harry went on a train with Nan.	33
12195	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	10	He was so excited, he forgot all about the bucket.	34
12196	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	4	Nan dried his eyes.	35
12197	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	4	“Never mind,” she said.	36
12198	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	7	“I’ll buy you a nice new video.”	37
12199	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	6	Harry watched the DVD with Sam.	38
12200	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	8	It was nice, but not like the dinosaurs.	39
12201	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	9	At bedtime, Harry said to Mum, “I like DVDs.	40
12202	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	21	But 1 like my dinosaurs better because you can fix them, you can bath them, you can take them to bed.	41
12203	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	17	And best of all, you can say their names” Harry was still upset at breakfast next morning.	42
12204	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	5	Sam said, “Dusty old junk!”	43
12205	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	9	That was why Sam’s book got milk on it.	44
12206	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	9	Nan took Harry to his room to settle down.	45
12207	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	15	Later, Nan took Harry back to the train station to see the Lost Property Man.	46
12208	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	4	The man said, “Dinosaurs?	47
12209	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	15	Yes we have found some dinosaurs, but how do we know they are your dinosaurs?”	48
12210	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	15	Harry said, “I will close my eyes and call their names Then you will know.”	49
12211	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	9	And Harry closed his eyes and called the names.	50
12212	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	6	He called, “Come back my Scelidosaurus!”	51
12213	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	1	Stegosaurus!”	52
12214	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	7	“Come back my “Come back my triceratops!”	53
12215	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	19	He called, ‘come back’, to the Apatosauruses and the Anchisauruses and the Tyrannosauruses and all the lost old dinosaurs.	54
12216	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	22	And when he opened his eyes… ... there they were — all of them standing on the counter next to the bucket!	55
12217	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	5	“All correct!” said the man.	56
12218	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	5	“These are definitely your dinosaurs.	57
12219	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	1	Definitely!”	58
12220	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	6	And the dinosaurs whispered to Harry.	59
12221	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	12	They whispered very quietly, but just loud enough for Harry to hear.	60
12222	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	8	They said, “You are definitely our Harry, definitely!”	61
12223	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	11	Going home from the station, Harry held the bucket very tight.	62
12224	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	11	Nan said to the neighbour, “Our Harry likes those old dinosaurs.”	63
12225	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	3	“Definitely,” whispered Harry.	64
12226	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	6	And my dinosaurs definitely like me.	65
12227	Harry and the Bucketful of Dinosaurs	1	ENDOSAURUS	66
12228	Grandma Bird	11	Noi lived with his dad and six cats by the sea.	0
12229	Grandma Bird	11	It was summer and Noi was going to stay at Grandma’s.	1
12230	Grandma Bird	8	It was a long way to Grandma’s house.	2
12231	Grandma Bird	18	She lived by herself on a tiny rock where the wind cut in and the grass grew sideways.	3
12232	Grandma Bird	14	The only visitors were the birds who blew in and out on the breeze.	4
12233	Grandma Bird	5	Noi wasn’t sure about Grandma.	5
12234	Grandma Bird	12	She boiled up seaweed for soup and kept her teeth in ajar.	6
12235	Grandma Bird	9	At night they had to sleep top to tail.	7
12236	Grandma Bird	11	The blankets were itchy and Grandma snored like an old walrus.	8
12237	Grandma Bird	22	During the day, Grandma always seemed too busy with one thing ... or another ... and she never had time to play.	9
12238	Grandma Bird	11	So one morning, when the tide was out, Noi crept away.	10
12239	Grandma Bird	11	He hopped from rock to rock and pattered over wet sand.	11
12240	Grandma Bird	8	He dipped in and out of rock pools.	12
12241	Grandma Bird	8	Then he spotted something shimmering across the sand.	13
12242	Grandma Bird	9	It was a great big rock full of holes.	14
12243	Grandma Bird	10	Noi weaved in and out and skipped around its edges.	15
12244	Grandma Bird	10	It was a castle, a tall ship, a smuggler’s den.	16
12245	Grandma Bird	9	It was the barnacled back of an ancient whale.	17
12246	Grandma Bird	7	Outside, the sky swirled black and grey.	18
12247	Grandma Bird	4	A storm was brewing.	19
12248	Grandma Bird	16	Noi listened as the sea thrashed against the rocks and rain began trickling down the walls.	20
12249	Grandma Bird	19	Suddenly, with a flutter and a squawk, something tumbled out of the storm and landed in Noi s cave.	21
12250	Grandma Bird	10	It was a little bird and it didn’t look well.	22
12251	Grandma Bird	7	The tiny bird shivered in Noi’s hands.	23
12252	Grandma Bird	8	He knew he must do something, and quickly.	24
12253	Grandma Bird	7	Maybe Grandma would know what to do.	25
12254	Grandma Bird	16	The tide had come in and it was hard to find a path across the rocks.	26
12255	Grandma Bird	9	Noi hopped, jumped and leapt with all his might.	27
12256	Grandma Bird	8	But the storm blew him left and right.	28
12257	Grandma Bird	21	Noi wondered how he would ever make it back to Grandmas ... when suddenly, a sail came cutting across the sea.	29
12258	Grandma Bird	3	“Grandma!” shouted Noi.	30
12259	Grandma Bird	10	“I’ve got you!” cried Grandma, as she scooped them aboard.	31
12260	Grandma Bird	5	“Thank goodness I found you!”	32
12261	Grandma Bird	2	she said.	33
12262	Grandma Bird	13	Grandma had started searching for Noi as soon as she heard the storm.	34
12263	Grandma Bird	13	As they sailed home, Noi and Grandma found more of the windswept birds.	35
12264	Grandma Bird	11	“They must have been on a long journey together,” said Grandma.	36
12265	Grandma Bird	13	The house was soon full of chatter and the ruffle of drying wings.	37
12266	Grandma Bird	12	I Once the storm had passed, the birds went on their way.	38
12267	Grandma Bird	7	Only Noi’s bird didn’t want to leave.	39
12268	Grandma Bird	8	“I think he likes you, Grandma!” said Noi.	40
12269	Grandma Bird	12	Noi wondered if Grandma ever felt lonely living out here by herself.	41
12270	Grandma Bird	14	They spent the rest of the summer together, exploring every rock and shore... ...	42
12271	Grandma Bird	5	and Grandma’s bird came too.	43

12543	What The Ladybird Heard Next	17	"They dug and they dug, and Len said, ""Pooh, It stinks!"" and Hugh said, ""So do you."""	51
12544	What The Ladybird Heard Next	11	And Len said, “Where’s that giant bird, The super-super Snuggly Snerd?”	52
12545	What The Ladybird Heard Next	6	“She’s rather shy,” the goose replied.	53
12546	What The Ladybird Heard Next	6	“She must be hiding deep inside.	54
12547	What The Ladybird Heard Next	8	So they dug a tunnel, nice and deep.	55
12548	What The Ladybird Heard Next	4	"""That's it!"" said Hugh."	56
12549	What The Ladybird Heard Next	4	"""Now, in we creep."""	57
12550	What The Ladybird Heard Next	7	“I think we’re nearly there,” said Len.	58
12551	What The Ladybird Heard Next	6	“The Snerd will soon be ours!”	59
12552	What The Ladybird Heard Next	14	"But then… The heap collapsed, and Hugh said ""Yuk, We're covered head-to-toe in muck."""	60
12553	What The Ladybird Heard Next	7	"And Len complained, ""There is no Snerd."	61
12554	What The Ladybird Heard Next	7	"They just made up that giant bird."""	62
12555	What The Ladybird Heard Next	13	Then the other animals gathered round And all let out a deafening sound.	63
12556	What The Ladybird Heard Next	1	Neigh!	64
12557	What The Ladybird Heard Next	1	Moo!	65
12558	What The Ladybird Heard Next	1	Oink!	66
12559	What The Ladybird Heard Next	1	Baa!	67

12561	What The Ladybird Heard Next	1	Miaow!	69
12562	What The Ladybird Heard Next	3	What a racket!	70
12563	What The Ladybird Heard Next	3	What a row!	71
12564	What The Ladybird Heard Next	7	"The farmer woke and said, ""Goodness me!"""	72
12565	What The Ladybird Heard Next	19	And he had a word with his prize Queen Bee, And the bees chased after the two bad men.	73
12566	What The Ladybird Heard Next	8	Who never came back to the farm again!	74
12567	What The Ladybird Heard Next	10	"Then the cow said, ""Moo!"" and the hen said, ""Cluck!"""	75
12568	What The Ladybird Heard Next	4	"""Hiss!"" said the goose."	76
12569	What The Ladybird Heard Next	4	"""Quack!"" said the duck."	77

12571	What The Ladybird Heard Next	29	"""Oink!"" said the hog, ""Baa!"" said the sheep and ""Woof!"" said the dog, And the farmer cheered, and both cats purred, But the ladybird said never a word ..."	79
12572	What The Ladybird Heard Next	6	And neither did the Snuggly Snerd.	80
12573	The Pirates Next Door	20	Matilda lived in Dull-on-Sea, a gloomy seaside town — too busy in the summer... an in winter it shut down.	0
12574	The Pirates Next Door	12	There weren’t too many kids around — just Tilda on her street.	1
12575	The Pirates Next Door	13	The lawns were mowed, the cars were washed, the hedges trimmed and neat.	2
12576	The Pirates Next Door	13	The house next door had been for sale since Tilda was a baby.	3
12577	The Pirates Next Door	14	She hoped a family would move in with a girl her age or maybe...	4
12578	The Pirates Next Door	2	A boy!	5
12579	The Pirates Next Door	3	A PIRATE BOY!	6
12580	The Pirates Next Door	1	“AHOY!!”	7
12581	The Pirates Next Door	10	He had patched-up jeans, an EYEPATCH and a WOODEN-LEGGED dog!	8
12582	The Pirates Next Door	12	And a PIRATE SHIP with TREASURE CHESTS and barrels full of GROG!	9
12583	The Pirates Next Door	3	“Were the JOLLEY-ROGERS!	10
12584	The Pirates Next Door	5	We’ll be anchoring next door.	11
12585	The Pirates Next Door	12	We’ve sailed the seven seas but now we’ve had to come ashore.”	12
12586	The Pirates Next Door	10	I feel a little landsick, but Mum says it’ll pass.	13
12587	The Pirates Next Door	9	That’s my mother over there, digging up the grass.”	14
12588	The Pirates Next Door	1	.4	15
12589	The Pirates Next Door	10	That’s Dad over yonder – the captain of our crew.	16
12590	The Pirates Next Door	5	He likes to shout “Oo-Arr!”	17
12591	The Pirates Next Door	5	cos that’s what pirates do.	18
12592	The Pirates Next Door	6	“Grandpa won’t set foot on shore.	19
12593	The Pirates Next Door	5	He’s allergic to dry land.	20
12594	The Pirates Next Door	14	The last time that he left the ship the King chopped off his hand!”	21
12595	The Pirates Next Door	5	“That urchin there’s called Nugget.	22
12596	The Pirates Next Door	6	She’s a rascal as you’ll see.	23
12597	The Pirates Next Door	13	She ain’t learnt to fire a cannon yet, hut then she’s only three.”	24
12598	The Pirates Next Door	10	Next morning, Tilda blurted: “Life’s not BORING FANTASTIC any more!	25
12599	The Pirates Next Door	8	Isn’t it that those pirates moved next door?”	26
12600	The Pirates Next Door	7	But Mum and Dad were not impressed...	27
12601	The Pirates Next Door	4	“The neighbourhood will sneer.	28
12602	The Pirates Next Door	9	The way they dress - the way they speak!	29
12603	The Pirates Next Door	6	They won’t fit in round here.	30
12604	The Pirates Next Door	10	Their lad is always playing with the most alarming toys...	31
12605	The Pirates Next Door	10	We’d rather you were friends with NORMAL girls and boys.”	32
12606	The Pirates Next Door	11	But that very day young JIM LAD came to Matilda’s school.	33
12607	The Pirates Next Door	8	Though NO ONE else would sit by him...	34
12608	The Pirates Next Door	4	Matilda said... “You’re Cool!”	35
12609	The Pirates Next Door	8	“You ain t so had yerself, my lass.	36
12610	The Pirates Next Door	5	For a landlubber, that’s rare.	37
12611	The Pirates Next Door	11	I’m a SCURVY SEA DOG, but ye’ll be alright sitting there!”	38
12612	The Pirates Next Door	12	The teacher said Jim .should wear SHOES... and his uniform was wrong.	39
12613	The Pirates Next Door	4	She wrote a note...	40
12614	The Pirates Next Door	15	But Jim replied, “We’re only ’ere a little while, so Dad can fix our ship.	41
12615	The Pirates Next Door	15	We ain’t cut out for life on land - this stay he just a blip.	42
12616	The Pirates Next Door	11	We are the Jolley-Rogers and we need to be at sea.	43
12617	The Pirates Next Door	11	School’s just grand but understand it’s a PIRATE’s life for me!”	44
12618	The Pirates Next Door	10	After school, a neighbour came around for cake and tea.	45
12619	The Pirates Next Door	8	Her name was Mrs Bumble from number thirty-three.	46
12620	The Pirates Next Door	11	“Miss Pinky called the council, to see what they could do.	47
12621	The Pirates Next Door	13	She didn’t live through two world wars, to have PIRATES spoil her view!”	48
12622	The Pirates Next Door	8	“Isn’t it DISGRACEFUL, on such a lovely street?	49
12623	The Pirates Next Door	12	You’d think that they would TRY to keep their garden looking neat!”	50
12624	The Pirates Next Door	12	“They have to go!” said Miss Divine who lived at number eighty-nine.	51
12625	The Pirates Next Door	9	“Their teeth a re black... their nails are too!	52
12626	The Pirates Next Door	6	This dirtiness just will not do.	53
12627	The Pirates Next Door	3	They never wash.	54
12628	The Pirates Next Door	4	Their kids have lice.	55
12629	The Pirates Next Door	6	They really don’t smell very nice.”	56
12630	The Pirates Next Door	7	“They wear old clothes and scruffy hats.	57
12631	The Pirates Next Door	9	And I’m told their ships are full of rats!”	58
12632	The Pirates Next Door	10	Also cross was Mr Shaw, the grumpy man at thirty-four.	59
12633	The Pirates Next Door	10	He liked to read the paper on his sunlit patio.	60
12634	The Pirates Next Door	15	But the pirates’ ship blocked out the light, so he said... “They’ll have to go!	61
12635	The Pirates Next Door	12	I’d like some PEACE and QUIET, hut they’re fixing up that boat!	62
12636	The Pirates Next Door	5	Hammering all day and night.	63
12637	The Pirates Next Door	5	That thing will NEVER float!”	64
12638	The Pirates Next Door	18	The two Miss Yates at eighty-eight, told everyone who passed their gate: “We saw them grab the POSTMAN.	65
12639	The Pirates Next Door	6	They made him walk the plank!	66
12640	The Pirates Next Door	11	It’s lucky he can swim hut we’re afraid his postbag sank.”	67
12641	The Pirates Next Door	12	r “They scared the ducks,” said Mrs Snucks, “and terrorised the park.	68
12642	The Pirates Next Door	10	They hoarded people’s rowboats and fired CANNONS for a lark!”	69
12643	The Pirates Next Door	11	Driving home from bingo, Mrs Plumb got a quite a fright.	70
12644	The Pirates Next Door	12	“They were digging up the roundabout in the middle of the night!”	71
12645	The Pirates Next Door	12	“They have CUTLASSES,” said Mr Brown, “and love to run you through!	72
12646	The Pirates Next Door	8	They’ll steal your GOLD, or so I’m told.	73
12647	The Pirates Next Door	6	What are we all to do?”	74
12648	The Pirates Next Door	10	Mrs Bevan from eighty-seven marched down to the Town Hall.	75
12649	The Pirates Next Door	8	She’d collected a petition fifty signatures in all.	76
12650	The Pirates Next Door	6	“They’re digging holes and fighting fights.	77
12651	The Pirates Next Door	5	The beginning of the END!	78
12652	The Pirates Next Door	13	I’ve lived here for years and years, and so have all my friends.	79
12653	The Pirates Next Door	15	Before you know it, there’ll be more - we’ll all have pirates lodged next door!	80
12654	The Pirates Next Door	4	The Jolley-Rogers cannot stay.	81
12655	The Pirates Next Door	6	YOU must make them GO AWAY!”	82
12656	The Pirates Next Door	10	That night there was a tapping at Matilda’s window pane.	83
12657	The Pirates Next Door	3	Outside was Jim.	84
12658	The Pirates Next Door	16	He whispered: “I’ve got something to explain… Whenever we stop somewhere new, the neighbours are unkind.	85
12659	The Pirates Next Door	12	To show them pirates aren’t so bad, we leave some things behind.	86
12660	The Pirates Next Door	9	Now the Blackhole’s shipshape, it’s time we sailed away.	87
12661	The Pirates Next Door	13	And I’ll be sad to leave as I have so enjoyed our stay.	88
12662	The Pirates Next Door	12	But we pirates need ADVENTURE - to see lands across the ocean.	89
12663	The Pirates Next Door	11	We need CUTLASSES and TREASURE MAPS and lots of suntan lotion!	90
12664	The Pirates Next Door	8	Though our visit here just has to end.	91
12665	The Pirates Next Door	8	I hope that you’ll still be my friend?	92
12666	The Pirates Next Door	9	If you want, we can send you something notes.	93
12667	The Pirates Next Door	6	handy - a thing that floats...”	94
12668	The Pirates Next Door	10	Matilda woke next morning, puzzled by what Jim had said.	95
12669	The Pirates Next Door	14	She vowed she’d keep in touch with him as she struggled out of bed.	96
12670	The Pirates Next Door	23	She opened up her curtains as she stretched and had a yawn, And there, to her amazement, was a cross on every lawn!	97
12671	The Pirates Next Door	6	“Oh what a SHAME they left!”	98
12672	The Pirates Next Door	4	“I didn’t say goodbye.”	99
12673	The Pirates Next Door	12	“They were such a lovely family” “I think I’m going to cry!”	100
12674	The Pirates Next Door	7	“I’m such a pirate fan you know.”	101
12675	The Pirates Next Door	5	“They wore such pretty hats.”	102
12676	The Pirates Next Door	5	“I rather LIKED their singing.”	103
12677	The Pirates Next Door	6	“And I’ll MISS those fluffy rats!”	104
12678	The Pirates Next Door	8	After that, the town went on landlubbing happily.	105
12679	The Pirates Next Door	11	But Tilda now goes fishing on the jetty by the sea.	106
12680	The Pirates Next Door	23	She’s waiting for a message to wash up on the shore from her very special PIRATE friend the one who lived NEXT DOOR.	107
12681	The Pirates Next Door	12	So now it’s the school holidays, you can come aboard our ship!	108
12682	The Pirates Next Door	11	We’ll pick you up next Tuesday, for a special pirate trip.	109
12683	The Pirates Next Door	3	Jim Lad xxx	110
12684	Captain Duck	6	Pop, pop, coughs the spluttering truck.	0
12685	Captain Duck	6	“No more petrol left,” quacks Duck.	1
12686	Captain Duck	27	“It’s good I stopped near my friend Goat, he uses petrol in his boat” Duck rap-tap-taps at Goat’s back door, waits a while, then taps once more.	2
12687	Captain Duck	12	Still no answer, so instead, he sneaks a peek inside Goat’s shed.	3
12688	Captain Duck	13	“Hooray!” cries Duck “A stroke of luck - petrol for my thirsty truck.	4
12689	Captain Duck	7	I’ll only take a drop or two...	5
12690	Captain Duck	3	Look, there’s Frog!	6
12691	Captain Duck	4	Where’s he off to?”	7
12692	Captain Duck	9	He’s off to take a trip on a boat.	8
12693	Captain Duck	3	“Hello!” calls Sheep.	9
12694	Captain Duck	4	“Hop in!” says Goat.	10
12695	Captain Duck	8	“There’s one last thing I need to bring...	11
12696	Captain Duck	8	Now while I’m gone, don’t pull that string.”	12
12697	Captain Duck	8	They check the map and pack the snack.	13
12698	Captain Duck	6	Then suddenly, they hear a quack.	14
12699	Captain Duck	6	“Ahoy there, sailors!” comes a cry.	15
12700	Captain Duck	7	“Is this a boating trip I spy?	16
12701	Captain Duck	9	If there are seas to be explored, CAPTAIN DUCK’S	17
12702	Captain Duck	2	ON BOARD!	18
12703	Captain Duck	2	make way...	19
12704	Captain Duck	3	Let’s get going!	20
12705	Captain Duck	3	What’s this thing?”	21
12706	Captain Duck	3	“No!” cries Frog.	22
12707	Captain Duck	4	“Don’t pull that string!”	23
12708	Captain Duck	7	The engine roars, Frog gives a shout.	24
12709	Captain Duck	4	“Oh, no!” screams Sheep.	25
12710	Captain Duck	3	“Frog’s fallen out!”	26
12711	Captain Duck	5	“Grab that rope,” says Duck.	27
12712	Captain Duck	2	“I’ll steer.	28
12713	Captain Duck	7	Throw it out when we get near.	29
12714	Captain Duck	2	Ready.. .steady..	30
12715	Captain Duck	2	.get set..	31
12716	Captain Duck	1	.THROW!	32
12717	Captain Duck	3	Catch!” yells Duck.	33
12718	Captain Duck	4	“And here we go.	34
12719	Captain Duck	6	I didn’t know Frog could water-ski?”	35
12720	Captain Duck	7	“No,” bleats Sheep, “and nor did he.	36
12721	Captain Duck	3	Oh, please, Duck.	37
12722	Captain Duck	5	Please don’t go too far.	38
12723	Captain Duck	6	Goat will wonder where we are.	39
12724	Captain Duck	7	I think you’d better stop it now...”	40
12725	Captain Duck	4	“I can’t,” yells Duck.	41
12726	Captain Duck	4	“I don’t know how.	42
12727	Captain Duck	12	Besides we’ve only just begun... and Frog is having so much fun.”	43
12728	Captain Duck	20	So Captain Duck steers the boat far away from poor old Goat i who finds his can beside a truck.	44
12729	Captain Duck	3	“Aha!” he says.	45
12730	Captain Duck	3	“That naughty Duck.”	46
12731	Captain Duck	13	The little boat bobs on and on until the river banks are gone.	47
12732	Captain Duck	12	Just then the engine pop-pop-pops and with a final cough it stops.	48
12733	Captain Duck	6	The stormy waves begin to swell.	49
12734	Captain Duck	7	Sheep says “I don’t feel too well.”	50
12735	Captain Duck	8	“Come on,” says Duck, “we’ll row to shore.”	51
12736	Captain Duck	4	“We can’t,” gasps Frog.	52
12737	Captain Duck	4	“There’s just one oar.”	53
12738	Captain Duck	13	They huddle in the bobbing boat and snuggle close to Sheep’s warm coat.	54
12739	Captain Duck	12	And there upon the restless deep three lost friends fall fast asleep.	55
12740	Captain Duck	12	Through the night, Goat keeps lookout hour by hour, from his tower.	56
12741	Captain Duck	14	And then at dawn, through bleary eyes, upon the tide, his boat he spies.	57
12742	Captain Duck	6	Sheep calls out, “We’re sorry, Goat.	58
12743	Captain Duck	4	We left you here...	59
12744	Captain Duck	4	we broke your boat!”	60
12745	Captain Duck	8	“Broken?” says Goat as Duck tries to hide.	61
12746	Captain Duck	7	“Oh, no, it just needed petrol inside.	62
12747	Captain Duck	11	That’s why I went back for the can I keep spare.	63
12748	Captain Duck	10	I searched through my shed but the can wasn’t there.”	64
12749	Captain Duck	1	“Wait!”	65
12750	Captain Duck	2	says Frog.	66
12751	Captain Duck	5	“Duck was holding a can!	67
12752	Captain Duck	8	It was just before our boat trip began.	68
12753	Captain Duck	5	So Duck took the petrol.”	69
12754	Captain Duck	4	“That’s right,” says Goat.	70
12755	Captain Duck	10	“Now you know why there wasn’t enough in the boat.”	71
12756	Captain Duck	1	“Look!	72
12757	Captain Duck	3	Duck’s getting away!”	73
12758	Captain Duck	2	Sheep cries.	74
12759	Captain Duck	3	“No, he’s not!”	75
12760	Captain Duck	8	gloats Goat with a glint in his eyes.	76
12761	Captain Duck	15	“He took the petrol, that silly Duck, but forgot to pour it into his truck!”	77
12762	The Little Bully	5	Billy was a cool kid.	0
12763	The Little Bully	5	He was nice to people.	1
12764	The Little Bully	5	He was nice to animals.	2
12765	The Little Bully	10	He had a nice smile, and he was very polite.	3
12766	The Little Bully	13	Billy had a lot of friends, and nobody was ever mean to him.	4
12767	The Little Bully	1	Fred.	5
12768	The Little Bully	12	Well, nobody except Fred could see the tiniest stain on Billy’s shirt.	6
12769	The Little Bully	3	“Billy spins EVERYTHING!	7
12770	The Little Bully	3	What a slob!”	8
12771	The Little Bully	14	If Billy made one mistake when he was writing, Fred would point and laugh.	9
12772	The Little Bully	6	“Billy can’t even write his name!”	10
12773	The Little Bully	9	For show-and-tell, Billy brought a drawing of his family.	11
12774	The Little Bully	6	He thought it was pretty great.	12
12775	The Little Bully	9	But Fred couldn’t stop laughing when he saw it.	13
12776	The Little Bully	5	“You used so much pink.	14
12777	The Little Bully	5	That’s a color for GIRLS!”	15
12778	The Little Bully	7	Billy tried to stand up for himself.	16
12779	The Little Bully	10	But no matter what he said, Fred would just laugh.	17
12780	The Little Bully	1	horrible.	18
12781	The Little Bully	11	It made Billy feel Billy started to think he wasn’t Smart.	19
12782	The Little Bully	2	Or funny.	20
12783	The Little Bully	5	Or nice to look at.	21
12784	The Little Bully	8	nobody Billy started to think that liked him.	22
12785	The Little Bully	8	Billy didn’t want to go to school anymore.	23
12786	The Little Bully	13	But he didn’t want to tell his mom or dad the real reason.	24
12787	The Little Bully	1	dumb.	25
12788	The Little Bully	11	Instead, he said, “School is I just want to stay home.”	26
12789	The Little Bully	9	“Going to school is your job” Dad told him.	27
12790	The Little Bully	10	“It’s important for you to do your job” Mom said.	28
12791	The Little Bully	11	So Billy kept going to school, and Fred kept teasing him.	29
12792	The Little Bully	9	One day, Billy wore his favorite shirt to school.	30
12793	The Little Bully	7	Of course, Fred made fun of it.	31
12794	The Little Bully	5	“You’re wearing a baby shirt!”	32
12795	The Little Bully	8	Billy knew his shirt wasn’t a baby shirt.	33
12796	The Little Bully	5	He had a baby sister.	34
12797	The Little Bully	5	Babies hardly even wore shirts.	35
12798	The Little Bully	16	They usually wore pajamas, and they definitely didn’t wear cool orange shirts with trucks on them.	36
12799	The Little Bully	8	Before Billy said anything, he looked at Fred.	37
12800	The Little Bully	18	Fred’s shirt had a bear on it, he had paint on his pants, and his shoes were untied.	38
12801	The Little Bully	18	Fred didn’t have any other friends besides Billy, and it would be easy to make fun of him.	39
12802	The Little Bully	15	But Billy knew Fred’s shoes were untied because it was hard to keep shoes tied.	40
12803	The Little Bully	5	He liked Fred’s bear shirt.	41
12804	The Little Bully	14	And they had been painting that morning, everyone so had paint on their pants.	42
12805	The Little Bully	5	So Billy tried something new.	43
12806	The Little Bully	7	“I like my shirt” he said bravely.	44
12807	The Little Bully	5	“It’s not a baby shirt.”	45
12808	The Little Bully	10	“Well, your pants have paint all over them,” Fred said.	46
12809	The Little Bully	3	“So do yours.	47
12810	The Little Bully	15	And if you keep being mean to me, I won’t play with you,” Billy said.	48
12811	The Little Bully	9	Billy knew nobody else wanted to play with Fred.	49

12865	The Gruffalo's Child	15	The Gruffalo said that no gruffalo should Ever set foot in the deep dark wood.	0
12866	The Gruffalo's Child	2	“Why not?	1
12867	The Gruffalo's Child	2	Why not?”	2
12868	The Gruffalo's Child	12	“Because if you do The Big Bad Mouse will be after you.	3
12869	The Gruffalo's Child	7	I met him once,” said the Gruffalo.	4
12870	The Gruffalo's Child	8	“I met him a long long time ago.”	5

12872	The Gruffalo's Child	3	Tell us, Dad.	7
12873	The Gruffalo's Child	7	Is he terribly big and terribly bad?”	8
12874	The Gruffalo's Child	7	“I cant quite remember,” the Gruffalo said.	9
12875	The Gruffalo's Child	10	Then he thought for a minute and scratched his head.	10
12876	The Gruffalo's Child	14	“The Big Bad Mouse is terribly strong And big scaly tail is terribly long.	11
12877	The Gruffalo's Child	16	His eyes are like pools of terrible fire And his terrible whiskers are tougher than wire.	12

12879	The Gruffalo's Child	6	The Gruffalo’s Child was feeling brave.	14
12880	The Gruffalo's Child	8	So she tiptoed out of the gruffalo cave.	15
12881	The Gruffalo's Child	9	The snow fell fast and the wind blew wild.	16
12882	The Gruffalo's Child	7	Into the wood went the Gruffalo’s Child.	17
12883	The Gruffalo's Child	2	Aha! Oho!	18
12884	The Gruffalo's Child	5	A trail in the snow!	19
12885	The Gruffalo's Child	9	Whose is this trail and where does it go?	20
12886	The Gruffalo's Child	8	A tail poked out of a logpile house.	21
12887	The Gruffalo's Child	10	Could this be the tail of the Big Bad Mouse?	22
12888	The Gruffalo's Child	4	Out slid the creature.	23
12889	The Gruffalo's Child	14	His eyes were small And he didn’t have whiskers — no, none at all.	24
12890	The Gruffalo's Child	4	“You’re not the Mouse.”	25
12891	The Gruffalo's Child	5	“Not I,” said the snake.	26
12892	The Gruffalo's Child	9	“He’s down by the lake — eating gruffalo cake.”	27
12893	The Gruffalo's Child	9	The snow fell fast and the wind blew wild.	28
12894	The Gruffalo's Child	7	“I’m not scared,” said the Gruffalo’s Child.	29

12896	The Gruffalo's Child	5	Whose are these claw marks?	31
12897	The Gruffalo's Child	4	Where do they go?	32
12898	The Gruffalo's Child	8	Two eyes gleamed out of a treetop house.	33
12899	The Gruffalo's Child	10	Could these be the eyes of the Big Bad Mouse?	34
12900	The Gruffalo's Child	4	Down flew the creature.	35
12901	The Gruffalo's Child	4	His tail was short.	36
12902	The Gruffalo's Child	8	And he didn’t have whiskers of any sort.	37
12903	The Gruffalo's Child	4	“You’re not the Mouse.”	38
12904	The Gruffalo's Child	10	“Toowhoo, not I, But he’s somewhere nearby, eating gruffalo pie.	39

12906	The Gruffalo's Child	7	“I’m not scared,’’ said the Gruffalo’s Child.	41
12907	The Gruffalo's Child	2	Aha! Oho!	42
12908	The Gruffalo's Child	5	A track in the snow!	43
12909	The Gruffalo's Child	9	Whose is this track and where does it go?	44
12910	The Gruffalo's Child	3	Whiskers at last!	45
12911	The Gruffalo's Child	4	And an underground house!	46
12912	The Gruffalo's Child	10	Could this be the home of the Big Bad Mouse?	47
12913	The Gruffalo's Child	4	Out slunk the creature.	48
12914	The Gruffalo's Child	4	His eyes weren’t fiery.	49
12915	The Gruffalo's Child	4	His tail wasn’t scaly.	50
12916	The Gruffalo's Child	4	His whiskers weren’t wiry.	51
12917	The Gruffalo's Child	4	“You’re not the Mouse.”	52
12918	The Gruffalo's Child	4	“Oh no, not me.	53
12919	The Gruffalo's Child	8	He’s under a tree - drinking gruffalo tea.”	54
12920	The Gruffalo's Child	19	“It’s all a trick!” said the Gruffalo’s Child As she sat on a stump where the snow lay piled.	55
12921	The Gruffalo's Child	11	“I don’t believe in the Big Bad Mouse . . .”	56
12922	The Gruffalo's Child	10	“But here comes a little one, out of his house!	57
12923	The Gruffalo's Child	17	Not big, not bad, but a mouse at least – You’ll taste good as a midnight feast.”	58
12924	The Gruffalo's Child	4	“Wait!” said the mouse.	59
12925	The Gruffalo's Child	30	“Before you eat, There's a friend of mine that you ought to meet, if you’ll let me hop onto a hazel twig I’ll beckon my friend so bad and big.”	60
12926	The Gruffalo's Child	6	The Gruffalo’s Child unclenched her fist.	61
12927	The Gruffalo's Child	9	“The Big Bad Mouse — so he docs exist!”	62
12928	The Gruffalo's Child	7	The mouse hopped into the hazel tree.	63
12929	The Gruffalo's Child	8	He beckoned, then said, “Just wait and see.”	64
12930	The Gruffalo's Child	4	Out came the moon.	65
12931	The Gruffalo's Child	5	It was bright and round.	66
12932	The Gruffalo's Child	7	A terrible shadow fell onto the ground.	67
12933	The Gruffalo's Child	9	Who is this creature so big, bad and strong?	68
12934	The Gruffalo's Child	8	His tail and his whiskers are terribly long.	69
12935	The Gruffalo's Child	17	His ears are enormous, and over his shoulder He carries a nut as big as a boulder!	70
12936	The Gruffalo's Child	8	“The Big Bad Mouse!” yelled the Gruffalo's Child.	71
12937	The Gruffalo's Child	9	The mouse jumped down from the twig and smiled.	72
12938	The Gruffalo's Child	2	Ah a!	73
12939	The Gruffalo's Child	5	Oho! Prints in the snow.	74
12940	The Gruffalo's Child	4	Whose are these footprints?	75
12941	The Gruffalo's Child	4	Where do they go?	76
12942	The Gruffalo's Child	16	The footprints led to the gruffalo cave Where the Gruffalo’s Child was a hit less brave.	77
12943	The Gruffalo's Child	11	The Gruffalo’s Child was a bit less bored . . .	78
12944	The Gruffalo's Child	8	And the Gruffalo snored and snored and snored.	79

12956	Elephant Learns to Share	6	Hippo thought he was very mean.	11
12957	Elephant Learns to Share	6	On Friday, Elephant was really selfish.	12
12958	Elephant Learns to Share	12	He would not share any of the books in the library corner.	13
12959	Elephant Learns to Share	12	Little Lion said Elephant did not need all the books at once.	14
12960	Elephant Learns to Share	11	He said Elephant could only read one book at a time.	15
12961	Elephant Learns to Share	10	But Elephant said he wanted all the books for himself.	16
12962	Elephant Learns to Share	5	Little Lion told Miss Bird.	17
12963	Elephant Learns to Share	17	Miss Bird said Elephant could not stay in the library corner if he did not share nicely.	18
12964	Elephant Learns to Share	10	At playtime, Elephant found an old football under a bush.	19
12965	Elephant Learns to Share	31	Everyone wanted to play with it, but Elephant said he found it so it was his football and he did not have to share it if he did not want to.	20
12966	Elephant Learns to Share	4	His friends got cross.	21
12967	Elephant Learns to Share	8	They thought he was mean not to share.	22
12968	Elephant Learns to Share	8	On Saturday morning, Elephant's gran came to visit.	23
12969	Elephant Learns to Share	7	She had a nice surprise for Elephant.	24
12970	Elephant Learns to Share	8	It was a new bat and ball set.	25
12971	Elephant Learns to Share	16	It had a shiny red ball and a big wooden bat with a bright blue handle.	26
12972	Elephant Learns to Share	13	Elephant thought it was the best bat and ball set in the world.	27
12973	Elephant Learns to Share	12	r O O r r First of all, Elephant threw the ball.	28
12974	Elephant Learns to Share	5	He threw it really hard.	29
12975	Elephant Learns to Share	6	It went a long, long way.	30
12976	Elephant Learns to Share	5	Then Elephant swung the bat.	31
12977	Elephant Learns to Share	4	It swung really well.	32
12978	Elephant Learns to Share	4	Elephant was very pleased.	33
12979	Elephant Learns to Share	10	Next, Elephant tried to throw the ball... and bat it.	34
12980	Elephant Learns to Share	5	But it was no good.	35
12981	Elephant Learns to Share	10	Then he tried to bat the ball... and catch it.	36
12982	Elephant Learns to Share	6	But that was no good either.	37
12983	Elephant Learns to Share	4	Elephant was not pleased.	38
12984	Elephant Learns to Share	11	His new bat and ball set was no fun at all.	39
12985	Elephant Learns to Share	7	Elephant went off to find his friends.	40
12986	Elephant Learns to Share	5	They were by the swamp.	41
12987	Elephant Learns to Share	10	They were playing with an old bat and ball set.	42
12988	Elephant Learns to Share	23	The ball was not shiny at all and the bat’s handle was bent and broken - but everyone was having lots of fun.	43

12994	Elephant Learns to Share	9	They said he did not share with them ever!	49
12995	Elephant Learns to Share	11	So they did not want to share their game with him.	50
12996	Elephant Learns to Share	3	Elephant went home.	51
12997	Elephant Learns to Share	4	He felt very sad.	52
12998	Elephant Learns to Share	6	Elephant saw Gran in the garden.	53
12999	Elephant Learns to Share	7	She asked him why he was sad.	54
13000	Elephant Learns to Share	20	He told her that his friends did not want to share with him because he had never shared with them.	55
13001	Elephant Learns to Share	9	He said he wished he could put things right.	56
13002	Elephant Learns to Share	11	Gran told him to think about how he could do that.	57
13003	Elephant Learns to Share	5	Elephant had a good think.	58
13004	Elephant Learns to Share	13	He said he should say sorry to his friends for being so selfish.	59
13005	Elephant Learns to Share	18	He said he should ask his friends to come and play with his new bat and ball set.	60

13018	Elephant Learns to Share	3	Elephant was pleased.	73
13019	Elephant Learns to Share	6	Soon it was time for tea.	74
13020	Elephant Learns to Share	13	Gran had made a large cake with lots of cherries on the top.	75
13021	Elephant Learns to Share	3	It looked delicious.	76
13022	Elephant Learns to Share	6	Elephant cut the cake into slices.	77
13023	Elephant Learns to Share	8	He made sure everyone had a fair share.	78
13024	Elephant Learns to Share	8	He made sure everyone had a cherry, too.	79
13025	Elephant Learns to Share	15	He said it was nicer to share things with your friends... and much more fun!	80

13028	One Snowy Night	6	But Percy the park-keeper doesn’t mind.	1
13029	One Snowy Night	21	He puts on his warm coat and his big scarf and wears two pairs of woolly socks inside his Wellington boots.	2
13030	One Snowy Night	9	Percy likes to be out in the fresh air.	3
13031	One Snowy Night	11	In the middle of the park there is a little hut.	4
13032	One Snowy Night	5	This is where Percy lives.	5
13033	One Snowy Night	18	When it gets too cold to be outside, Percy goes into his hut where it’s cosy and warm.	6
13034	One Snowy Night	11	The animals who live in the park all know Percy’s hut.	7
13035	One Snowy Night	8	Every day he shares his lunch with them.	8

13037	One Snowy Night	10	Great big snowflakes fell past the window of Percy’s hut.	10
13038	One Snowy Night	3	“Brrr,” said Percy.	11
13039	One Snowy Night	8	“I think I’ll need an extra blanket tonight.”	12
13040	One Snowy Night	11	He made himself some hot cocoa and got ready for bed.	13
13041	One Snowy Night	6	Suddenly, Percy heard a tapping sound.	14
13042	One Snowy Night	6	There was somebody at the door.	15
13043	One Snowy Night	12	“Now who can that be at this time of night?” thought Percy.	16
13044	One Snowy Night	8	He went to the door and looked out.	17
13045	One Snowy Night	7	There on the step was a squirrel.	18
13046	One Snowy Night	6	It looked very cold and miserable.	19
13047	One Snowy Night	9	“I can’t get to sleep, Percy,” said the squirrel.	20
13048	One Snowy Night	6	“My bed is full of snow.”	21
13049	One Snowy Night	4	“Oh dear,” said Percy.	22
13050	One Snowy Night	9	“Never mind, I’ve got plenty of room for two.”	23
13051	One Snowy Night	13	The squirrel snuggled down next to Percy and soon began to feel warm.	24
13052	One Snowy Night	1	Knock!	25
13053	One Snowy Night	1	Knock!	26
13054	One Snowy Night	5	It was the door again.	27
13055	One Snowy Night	7	“Now who can that be?” thought Percy.	28
13056	One Snowy Night	6	Standing outside were two shivering rabbits.	29
13057	One Snowy Night	5	“It’s f-freezing,” said one rabbit.	30
13058	One Snowy Night	5	“We’re f-frozen,” said the other.	31
13059	One Snowy Night	5	“You poor things,” said Percy.	32
13060	One Snowy Night	5	“Come in and warm up.”	33
13061	One Snowy Night	12	The rabbits squeezed into the bed next to Percy and the squirrel.	34
13062	One Snowy Night	4	There wasn’t much room.	35
13063	One Snowy Night	6	“Could you face the other way?”	36
13064	One Snowy Night	4	Percy asked the squirrel.	37
13065	One Snowy Night	6	“Your tail is tickling my nose.”	38
13066	One Snowy Night	1	Knock!	39
13067	One Snowy Night	1	Knock!	40
13068	One Snowy Night	4	“Oh dear,” said Percy.	41
13069	One Snowy Night	7	“Now there’s someone else at the door!”	42
13070	One Snowy Night	4	It was a fox!	43
13071	One Snowy Night	6	He looked very cold and hungry.	44
13072	One Snowy Night	5	“Can I come in, too?”	45
13073	One Snowy Night	2	he asked.	46
13074	One Snowy Night	9	Percy scratched his head and thought for a minute.	47
13075	One Snowy Night	8	“Well, if you promise to behave,” he said.	48
13076	One Snowy Night	16	“I promise,” said the fox, and he squeezed into bed next to all the other animals.	49
13077	One Snowy Night	1	Bump!	50
13078	One Snowy Night	1	Oops!	51
13079	One Snowy Night	4	The squirrel fell out.	52
13080	One Snowy Night	7	“Who did that?” asked the squirrel crossly.	53
13081	One Snowy Night	3	Knock, knock, knock!	54
13082	One Snowy Night	4	“Good gracious!” said Percy.	55
13083	One Snowy Night	4	“It’s the door again.”	56
13084	One Snowy Night	7	This time Percy had quite a surprise.	57
13085	One Snowy Night	17	There on the step was a badger, two ducks, a hedgehog and a whole family of mice!	58
13086	One Snowy Night	8	They all wanted a bed for the night.	59
13087	One Snowy Night	3	Poor old Percy.	60
13088	One Snowy Night	5	And poor old Percy’s bed!	61
13089	One Snowy Night	20	The animals pushed and shoved and rolled around the bed, but there was just not enough room for them all.	62
13090	One Snowy Night	11	Soon the bed covers ended up in a big, tight ball.	63
13091	One Snowy Night	2	Then, bump!	64
13092	One Snowy Night	13	The covers rolled right off the bed and everybody fell onto the floor.	65
13093	One Snowy Night	4	“Oh dear,” said Percy.	66
13094	One Snowy Night	5	“This won’t do at all.	67
13095	One Snowy Night	6	My bed is just too small.”	68
13096	One Snowy Night	9	Suddenly, one of the mice pricked up his ears.	69
13097	One Snowy Night	3	“What’s that noise?”	70
13098	One Snowy Night	2	he squeaked.	71
13099	One Snowy Night	3	Everyone listened hard.	72
13100	One Snowy Night	6	Now they could all hear it.	73
13101	One Snowy Night	6	There was a scratching, scraping sound.	74
13102	One Snowy Night	8	It seemed to be coming from underneath them.	75
13103	One Snowy Night	8	“There’s something moving under the floor,” whispered Percy.	76
13104	One Snowy Night	13	The animals looked frightened and the mice all started to squeak at once.	77
13105	One Snowy Night	2	“Oh dear!”	78
13106	One Snowy Night	4	“What can it be?”	79
13107	One Snowy Night	5	“It might be a monster!”	80
13108	One Snowy Night	3	“With fierce claws!”	81
13109	One Snowy Night	3	“And sharp teeth!”	82
13110	One Snowy Night	6	The noise grew louder and louder.	83
13111	One Snowy Night	8	Then one of the floorboards began to move.	84
13112	One Snowy Night	2	“Look out!	85
13113	One Snowy Night	6	It’s coming up through the floor!”	86
13114	One Snowy Night	6	Suddenly, there was a loud creak.	87
13115	One Snowy Night	10	“Help!” cried the animals and they all ran to hide.	88
13116	One Snowy Night	1	-	89
13117	One Snowy Night	4	But Percy wasn’t frightened.	90
13118	One Snowy Night	4	He started to chuckle.	91
13119	One Snowy Night	5	Then he laughed out loud.	92
13120	One Snowy Night	10	A small, dark head was sticking up through the floorboards.	93
13121	One Snowy Night	6	“This isn’t a monster,” said Percy.	94
13122	One Snowy Night	3	“It’s a mole!”	95
13123	One Snowy Night	10	“I’m sorry to burst in like this,” said the mole.	96
13124	One Snowy Night	9	“I knocked on the door but nobody heard me.”	97
13125	One Snowy Night	26	Percy helped the mole up through the hole in the floor, sat him on his hot water bottle to get warm and put the floorboard back.	98
13126	One Snowy Night	6	“It’s all right everyone,” he called.	99
13127	One Snowy Night	5	“You can come out now.”	100
13128	One Snowy Night	3	But nobody moved.	101
13129	One Snowy Night	2	Nobody stirred.	102
13130	One Snowy Night	5	Nobody wanted to come out.	103
13131	One Snowy Night	12	The squirrel was tucked away in the pocket of Percy’s dressing gown.	104
13132	One Snowy Night	6	The hedgehog was in his coat.	105
13133	One Snowy Night	5	The fox . . .	106
13134	One Snowy Night	5	the rabbits . . .	107
13135	One Snowy Night	5	the badger . . .	108
13136	One Snowy Night	8	and the ducks were all safely hidden away.	109
13137	One Snowy Night	9	The mice had even squeezed themselves into Percy’s slippers!	110
13138	One Snowy Night	6	Everyone had found a cosy bed.	111
13139	One Snowy Night	5	“Well I never!” said Percy.	112
13140	One Snowy Night	11	Percy yawned and snuggled down in his own bed once again.	113
13141	One Snowy Night	2	“That’s better.	114
13142	One Snowy Night	8	Now I’ve got plenty of room,” he said.	115
13143	One Snowy Night	10	“And a little to spare . . . . .	116
13144	One Snowy Night	1	.	117

13148	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	18	In a towering forest, where summer had been, The cool air bit fresh and the mosses grew green.	0
13149	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	17	And as autumn edged in and the sky raged red, The sleepiest creatures got ready for bed.	1
13150	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	16	While, up in a tree, swung a flighty young squirrel, Who everyone knew as ‘Spontaneous Cyril’.	2
13151	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	13	Now, most foresty folk had seen to their needs, Through the plentiful months.	3
13152	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	4	of mushrooms and seeds.	4
13153	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	19	They’d built up their stores so they’d all be well fed Through the frosting of winter that glittered ahead.	5
13154	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	10	But Cyril, he lived in the NOW and the HERE.	6
13155	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	9	He’d adventured and partied his way through the year.	7
13156	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	9	So his cupboard was empty, his hollow was bare.	8
13157	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	8	He hadn’t a mouthful of food ANYWHERE. !	9
13158	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	5	BUT WAIT What was that?	10
13159	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	2	Over there!	11
13160	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	3	Take a look!	12
13161	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	8	A single lone pine-cone, wedged in a nook!	13
13162	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	12	He squealed with delight and for very good reason . . .	14
13163	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	5	For inside were the Very.	15
13164	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	1	Last.	16
13165	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	1	Nuts.	17
13166	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	1	Of.	18
13167	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	1	The.	19
13168	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	1	Season.	20
13169	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	4	BUT… Cyril wasn’t alone.	21
13170	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	5	There were more hungry eyes.	22
13171	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	9	Yes, ‘Plan-Ahead Bruce’ had his sights on the prize.	23
13172	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	17	Though he’d gathered a mountain of bounty, hard-fought, Bruce was convinced he was ONE PINE CONE SHORT.	24
13173	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	5	“I simply MUST have it!”	25
13174	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	12	he wistfully cried, as he dreamt of the fresh, juicy pine-nuts inside.	26
13175	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	17	So as Cyril set off on his way to the ground, Bruce, he was also LAST-PINE- CONE-bound!	27
13176	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	19	They sprinted and scurried – with no time to gamble, They scratched at the bark in their scampering scramble.	28
13177	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	21	But their panic and haste shook the tips of the spruce, And the pine-cone, it trembled and then . . .	29
13178	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	3	IT CAME LOOSE!	30
13179	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	8	Both Squirrels gave chase at a lightening pace.	31
13180	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	9	This was the start of a wild nutty race.	32
13181	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	5	“ “It’s mine!” shouted Cyril.	33
13182	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	10	“No, mine” hollered Bruce… “You don t stand a chance!	34
13183	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	2	Give up!	35
13184	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	3	It’s no use!”	36
13185	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	2	“I’m HUNGRY!”	37
13186	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	2	cried Cyril.	38
13187	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	5	“This cone is NOT yours!”	39
13188	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	4	“Stay back!” shouted Bruce.	40
13189	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	5	“This cone’s for MY stores!”	41
13190	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	9	It boinged over bushes… And flew through the air.	42
13191	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	9	It binged on the nose of a slumbering bear!	43
13192	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	9	It bounced over boulders then came to a STOP.	44
13193	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	10	Then teetered and wobbled and quivered and . . .	45
13194	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	1	PLOP!	46
13195	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	3	Both squirrels followed.	47
13196	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	1	Oh!	48
13197	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	4	The water was fast!	49
13198	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	10	Would they learn that they needed each other at last?	50
13199	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	1	EACH	51
13200	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	33	But was intent on how HE could win, So they didn’t quite notice A BIRD SWEEPING IN Cyril and Bruce, they watched in dismay, As their cone disappeared, up, Up… UP and AWAY!	52
13201	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	4	“Come back!” shouted Cyril.	53
13202	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	5	“They’re our nuts!” exclaimed Bruce.	54
13203	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	5	But all hope was gone.	55
13204	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	5	It was simply no use.	56
13205	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	9	And meanwhile they drifted right up to the ledge.	57
13206	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	8	Greed, it was driving them . . .	58
13207	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	4	; OVER THE EDGE.	59
13208	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	8	Cyril and Bruce, they had taken a fall.	60
13209	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	9	They were paying the price for wanting it all.	61
13210	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	9	They’d squandered their chances to team up and share.	62
13211	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	9	Would their nutty young hopes simply end in despair?	63
13212	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	8	Bruised and bedraggled, they swept past dry land.	64
13213	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	9	Cyril grabbed at a branch with a trembling hand.	65
13214	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	13	Catching Bruce with the other, he heaved and he huffed . . .	66
13215	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	9	And dragged him to safety, with panting and puffs.	67
13216	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	8	Let out a SNORT “How silly we are!”	68
13217	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	4	he proclaimed, all a-jiggle.	69
13218	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	9	“How greedy I’ve been!” spluttered Bruce with a giggle.	70
13219	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	5	“We shall change from today.	71
13220	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	4	May the squabbling cease.	72
13221	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	10	We should celebrate — seeing we’re both in one piece!”	73
13222	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	10	From that day and forward, they made a great pair.	74
13223	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	9	They would gather together and found they COULD share.	75
13224	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	12	Yes, Cyril and Bruce, they knew in the end . . .	76
13225	The Squirrels Who Squabbled	11	The BEST thing to share is a laugh with your friend.	77

13458	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	19	Below the misty blue mountain was a wild, dark forest and by the wild, dark forest was a village.	1
13459	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	25	The village had a stream and a duck pond and an old red apple tree Jack and it was home to and his fairytale friends.	2
13460	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	3	Jack loved climbing.	3
13461	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	21	He was always climbing the pine tree near his friend Beauty’s house... ...and the old red apple tree in Griselda’s garden.	4
13462	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	9	“Now don’t go climbing our beanstalks,” warned Jack’s mum.	5
13463	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	10	It was spring, and their seedlings were starting to grow.	6
13464	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	18	“The stalks will break and we’ll have no beans to make bean stew for the village Autumn festival.”	7
13465	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	5	“I won’t, Mum,” Jack promised.	8
13466	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	19	But that summer the beanstalks grew taller... taller... ... and taller, and until they were higher than Jack’s house!	9
13467	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	5	longed Jack to climb them.	10
13468	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	10	“I wonder how far you can see from the top!”	11
13469	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	11	he said to Cinderella as they were walking home from school.	12
13470	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	7	One night Jack couldn’t resist any longer.	13
13471	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	13	He crept out of the house and started to climb the nearest beanstalk.	14
13472	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	10	Creak! swayed the stalk, as Jack climbed through the leaves.	15
13473	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	2	Then, SNAP!	16
13474	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	8	The stalk broke and Jack tumbled down! n	17
13475	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	14	But Jack couldn’t resist trying again - surely he’d reach the top next time!	18
13476	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	8	So he started to climb the next beanstalk...	19

13483	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	6	“Something terrible has happened to our.	26

13486	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	3	“NO,” lied Jack.	29
13487	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	5	“Tell me the truth, Jack.	30
13488	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	3	Was it you?”	31
13489	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	15	“No,” lied Jack again “Remember, I’ve always taught you to be honest,” said Jack’s mum.	32
13490	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	5	“Did you break the beanstalks.	33
13491	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	1	Jack?”	34
13492	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	7	“NO,” lied Jack for a third time.	35
13493	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	6	“It must have been Griselda’s cat.	36
13494	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	1	Puss.”	37
13495	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	9	Jack ran away and hid in Griselda’s apple tree.	38
13496	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	8	“Whatever are you doing up there?” called Griselda.	39
13497	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	5	“‘I’ve lied to my mum.	40

13500	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	9	“Don’t you think you should tell her the truth?”	43
13501	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	2	Jack nodded.	44
13502	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	9	He knew it was the right thing to do.	45
13503	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	12	“But I don’t know what to do about our beanstalks,” said Jack.	46
13504	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	16	no beans “We have now bean stew’’ to make Griselda gave Jack a big purple bean.	47
13505	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	3	“Try planting this.”	48
13506	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	10	“It was me, Mum,” said Jack when he got home.	49
13507	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	11	“I’m sorry I broke the beanstalks and I’m sorry I lied.”	50
13508	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	10	“Oh, Jack, I knew it was you,” replied his mum.	51
13509	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	12	“I’ve been hoping and waiting for you to tell me the truth.”	52
13510	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	5	“Are you cross?” asked Jack.	53
13511	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	12	“Not now you’re being honest” said his mum, giving him a hug.	54
13512	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	12	“Look what Griselda gave me,” Jack said, showing his mum the bean.	55
13513	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	13	Jack and his mum planted Griselda’s purple bean in the garden that night.	56
13514	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	8	The next day they had a big surprise.	57
13515	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	1	magic	58
13516	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	23	The bean had grown like into a huge, leafy beanstalk with a thick, strong stem that reached all the way to the clouds.	59
13517	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	9	“Just look at those lovely beans” said Jack’s mum.	60
13518	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	9	“How are we going to pick them?” asked Jack.	61
13519	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	13	“I think you’re going to have to climb the beanstalk!” laughed his mum.	62
13520	Jack Breaks The Beanstalk	37	So Jack got to climb to the top of a beanstalk after all... lots ...and he picked so many beans, he and his mum were able to make bean Stew of lovely for that year’s Autumn festival.	63

13545	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	13	The next morning, the family was woken by something falling onto the doormat.	24

13547	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	4	“Christmas cards?” wondered Papa.	26
13548	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	3	“I’ll get them!”	27
13549	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	4	Mungo shouted, racing off.	28
13550	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	8	But Mungo was in for a big surprise.	29
13551	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	5	“Whoa! Button, look at this!”	30
13552	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	9	A mound of snow had fallen through the letterbox.	31

13557	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	14	“Snowball fight!” cheered Mungo, plumping a pawful into shape and hurling it at Button.	36
13558	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	1	“Oooch!”	37
13559	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	6	she squealed, aiming one right back.	38

13561	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	12	“Watch out, bear cubs!” boomed Papa, swinging the biggest snowball of all.	40
13562	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	7	But Mungo ducked, and – thwump! -	41
13563	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	7	Papa’s massive snowball hit the Christmas tree!	42
13564	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	7	“Oops!” he chuckled, leaping to the rescue.	43
13565	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	6	“No more indoor snowballs for us!	44
13566	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	4	Anyone fancy a snack?”	45

13569	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	5	“Let’s go out to play!”	48
13570	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	6	But Button couldn’t open the door.	49
13571	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	3	Neither could Mungo.	50
13572	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	7	“We’ll climb out the window,” decided Mungo.	51
13573	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	3	“Come on, Button!”	52
13574	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	9	He jumped up to pull the handle, and... Shlump!	53
13575	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	6	An avalanche of white tumbled in!	54
13576	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	1	“Whoohoo!	55
13577	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	19	I’ve got a great idea” grinned Mung and he began to roll a ball of snow around the floor.	56
13578	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	15	Button joined in, paws patting and eyes widening as the snowball got bigger and bigger.	57
13579	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	9	“We need a carrot!” called Mungo to the kitchen.	58

13590	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	6	“Is that Santa already?” asked Button.	69
13591	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	4	“It’s not night-time yet...”	70

13593	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	3	Downstairs!” shouted Mungo.	72
13594	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	7	But when they got there ... Flooooof!	73
13595	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	14	A humongous pillow of snow plunged down the chimney and the fire went out.	74
13596	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	3	“Crumbs’” gulped Papa.	75
13597	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	7	‘Now this really IS too much snow!”	76
13598	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	4	Even Mungo looked worried.	77
13599	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	13	“If the chimney is blocked, how will Santa deliver our presents?” he cried.	78
13600	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	4	“It’s all my fault!”	79
13601	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	2	sobbed Button.	80
13602	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	12	“I wished it would snow for ever, and now THIS has happened!”	81
13603	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	12	“Don’t worry,” comforted Papa, gathering up Button in his big bear paws.	82
13604	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	5	“We’ll help Santa get through.”	83
13605	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	7	“We could use the broom?” offered Mungo.	84
13606	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	4	“Great idea!” agreed Papa.	85
13607	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	16	He squished into the sooty chimney and pushed the broom up as far as he could.	86
13608	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	9	But even on tiptoe, he couldn’t reach the top.	87
13609	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	7	“We’ll help, won’t we, Button?” announced Mungo.	88
13610	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	18	So the bear cubs climbed up onto Papa’s shoulders, and with a wriggle and a heave ... ...	89
13611	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	4	the broom popped out!	90
13612	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	4	“I can see stars!”	91
13613	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	2	squeaked Button.	92
13614	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	3	“Phew!” chuckled Papa.	93
13615	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	5	“I think we’ve saved Christmas!”	94
13616	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	11	After a good wash, the three bears cuddled by the fire.	95
13617	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	8	“Are you sure Santa will come?” mumbled Button.	96
13618	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	4	“Of course,” grinned Papa.	97
13619	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	19	The snow had stopped falling at last and the forest looked as glittery as the pictures in Button’s book.	98
13620	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	11	“I love snow,” she murmured dreamily as they headed for bed.	99
13621	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	17	And while the bears slept soundly, Santa climbed down the chimney to leave them the perfect present.	100
13622	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	9	“A sledge!” cheered the bear cubs the next morning.	101
13623	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	8	“Just right for the snowiest y* Christmas ever!	102
13624	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	1	•	103
13625	The Snowiest Christmas Ever	1	Wheeeeeee	104
13626	Jack and the Beanstalk	15	Once upon a time, in the age of magic, there was a boy called Jack.	0
13627	Jack and the Beanstalk	12	He lived with his mother in a little house on their farm.	1
13628	Jack and the Beanstalk	15	They were very poor, and the only possession they had left was Daisy the cow.	2
13629	Jack and the Beanstalk	18	Daisy was a very nice, but very old, cow and was the only real friend that Jack had.	3
13630	Jack and the Beanstalk	20	But one day Jack’s mother decided he must take Daisy to market and sell her or else they would starve.	4
13631	Jack and the Beanstalk	13	I The next morning Jack set off with Daisy, to walk to market.	5
13632	Jack and the Beanstalk	5	His mother waved them goodbye.	6
13633	Jack and the Beanstalk	7	“Make sure you get a good price!”	7
13634	Jack and the Beanstalk	2	she said.	8
13635	Jack and the Beanstalk	20	Jack was sad to be selling Daisy, so he walked very slowly, hoping to be too late for the market.	9
13636	Jack and the Beanstalk	8	After a while they met an old man.	10
13637	Jack and the Beanstalk	4	He looked very odd.	11
13638	Jack and the Beanstalk	12	He was bent almost double and wore strange clothes, all coloured green.	12
13639	Jack and the Beanstalk	7	“Good morning, boy,” said the old man.	13
13640	Jack and the Beanstalk	4	“What a fine cow.	14
13641	Jack and the Beanstalk	5	Where are you taking her?”	15
13642	Jack and the Beanstalk	19	“I must take her to market and sell her, for we are very poor,” said Jack with a sigh.	16
13643	Jack and the Beanstalk	11	“I never saw such a splendid animal,” said the old man.	17
13644	Jack and the Beanstalk	7	“I should like to buy her myself.”	18
13645	Jack and the Beanstalk	11	And with that he took out five beans from his purse.	19
13646	Jack and the Beanstalk	7	Jack had hoped for some gold coins.	20
13647	Jack and the Beanstalk	8	“I couldn’t sell Daisy for beans,” he said.	21
13648	Jack and the Beanstalk	10	“Ah,” said the old man, “but these are magic beans.	22
13649	Jack and the Beanstalk	11	Plant them in your garden by moonlight and you will see.”	23
13650	Jack and the Beanstalk	10	When Jack got home, his mother called him a fool.	24
13651	Jack and the Beanstalk	9	It was worse than she had feared, she said.	25
13652	Jack and the Beanstalk	5	Now they really would starve.	26
13653	Jack and the Beanstalk	18	But Jack believed the old man, and that night, under the full moon, he planted the five beans.	27
13654	Jack and the Beanstalk	5	His mother woke him early.	28
13655	Jack and the Beanstalk	5	“Now look what you’ve done!”	29
13656	Jack and the Beanstalk	2	she cried.	30
13657	Jack and the Beanstalk	9	Jack hopped out of bed, and into the garden.	31
13658	Jack and the Beanstalk	6	Those beans really had been magic.	32
13659	Jack and the Beanstalk	11	Where he had planted them there now stood an enormous beanstalk.	33
13660	Jack and the Beanstalk	10	It stretched up into the sky and beyond the clouds.	34
13661	Jack and the Beanstalk	13	Jack saw at once a chance for adventure and perhaps even a fortune.	35
13662	Jack and the Beanstalk	5	Straightaway he began to climb.	36
13663	Jack and the Beanstalk	20	Up and up he went, higher and higher, until he found himself above the clouds and in a different world.	37
13664	Jack and the Beanstalk	19	Ahead of him stretched a long twisty road and at the end of the road stood a huge castle.	38
13665	Jack and the Beanstalk	14	Jack walked up to the castle and climbed the steep steps to the door.	39
13666	Jack and the Beanstalk	9	“Whoever lives here must be a giant” said Jack.	40
13667	Jack and the Beanstalk	21	He slipped into the castle through a crack in the door and came into a vast room with a fire blazing.	41
13668	Jack and the Beanstalk	22	By the table was a wooden cage and in the cage Jack could see a fat white goose tied by a rope.	42
13669	Jack and the Beanstalk	1	“Honk!	43
13670	Jack and the Beanstalk	21	Help me escape from here,” said the goose, “and you will never be poor again, for I am a magic goose.”	44
13671	Jack and the Beanstalk	20	Now Jack had good reason to believe in magic; the old man had been right about the beans after all.	45
13672	Jack and the Beanstalk	4	“All right,” said Jack.	46
13673	Jack and the Beanstalk	9	“I’ll have you out of there in no time.”	47
13674	Jack and the Beanstalk	17	But as he started to pull on the bars there came a sound like thunder, BOOM ...	48
13675	Jack and the Beanstalk	1	BOOM...	49
13676	Jack and the Beanstalk	12	BOOM, and with it a voice low and loud . . .	50
13677	Jack and the Beanstalk	7	“Quick,” said the goose, “it’s the giant!	51
13678	Jack and the Beanstalk	1	Hide!”	52
13679	Jack and the Beanstalk	12	So Jack climbed onto the table and hid behind a huge egg-cup.	53
13680	Jack and the Beanstalk	9	The door crashed open and in walked the giant.	54
13681	Jack and the Beanstalk	21	He sat at the table, banged down his great fist, and laughed, “Ho, ho, ho ... where is my lovely goosey-goosey?”	55
13682	Jack and the Beanstalk	9	The giant picked up the cage and the goose.	56
13683	Jack and the Beanstalk	22	He pulled open the door, sat the poor goose down in the middle of the table, and boomed out, “Lay, goose, lay.”	57
13684	Jack and the Beanstalk	11	The goose let out a sad “honk”, and laid an egg.	58
13685	Jack and the Beanstalk	21	The giant picked up the egg and laughed again, “Ho, ho, ho,” and then carefully put the egg in the egg-cup.	59
13686	Jack and the Beanstalk	7	It was an egg of solid gold.	60
13687	Jack and the Beanstalk	9	Jack stared — it really was a magic goose.	61
13688	Jack and the Beanstalk	26	“Lay, goose, lay,” said the giant again, and again the goose laid a golden egg, and so on until it had laid six eggs in all.	62
13689	Jack and the Beanstalk	14	Jack watched as the giant fell asleep with a big smile on his face.	63
13690	Jack and the Beanstalk	16	Jack crept out from behind the egg-cup and quickly untied the rope from the goose’s neck.	64
13691	Jack and the Beanstalk	7	“Climb onto my back,” said the goose.	65
13692	Jack and the Beanstalk	15	And with Jack on her back she flew up and out of the castle window.	66
13693	Jack and the Beanstalk	22	The flap of her wings woke the giant, and as they flew down the road towards the beanstalk, he blundered after them.	67
13694	Jack and the Beanstalk	2	“Come back!”	68
13695	Jack and the Beanstalk	2	he shouted.	69
13696	Jack and the Beanstalk	13	Jack hurled himself down the beanstalk, while the goose flew down beside him.	70
13697	Jack and the Beanstalk	11	But the giant started to climb down the beanstalk as well.	71
13698	Jack and the Beanstalk	19	Jack saw his mother at the bottom of the beanstalk and he called to her to fetch the axe.	72
13699	Jack and the Beanstalk	23	As soon as Jack reached the ground he took the axe and chopped until the beanstalk and the giant crashed to the ground.	73
13700	Jack and the Beanstalk	21	The giant, being so heavy, made such a hole that he fell right through the earth and was never seen again.	74
13701	Jack and the Beanstalk	10	When Jack’s mother saw the huge goose she was cross.	75
13702	Jack and the Beanstalk	5	“Whatever is that ugly bird?”	76
13703	Jack and the Beanstalk	2	she said.	77
13704	Jack and the Beanstalk	11	“We can hardly feed ourselves, let alone a thing like that.”	78
13705	Jack and the Beanstalk	6	“It’s a magic goose,” said Jack.	79
13706	Jack and the Beanstalk	2	“Watch this.	80
13707	Jack and the Beanstalk	15	Lay, goose, lay,” he said to the goose, and patted it kindly on the head.	81
13708	Jack and the Beanstalk	24	The goose let out a happy “honk” and laid a single golden egg, as it did once a year every year from then on.	82
13709	Jack and the Beanstalk	19	And so Jack, and his mother, and the goose, lived happily in comfort for the rest of their days.	83
13710	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	15	Sid was a sausage dog who lived in the kennels on the edge of town.	0
13711	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	20	He lived there because he didn’t have a nice kind owner to love and care for him like other dogs.	1
13712	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	9	Sid wanted a nice kind owner more than anything.	2
13713	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	8	So he decided to find one for himself!	3
13714	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	31	First Sid took a giant leap over the kennel wall, to show what a good jumper he was… But… ... he landed on top of Madam Murples’ very fancy tea party.	4
13715	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	5	“Silly Sid!” screeched the ladies.	5
13716	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	6	“Back to the kennels at once!”	6
13717	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	12	Then Sid tried to show everyone what a good digger he was.	7
13718	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	2	But... ...	8
13719	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	8	he dug up all Gardener Pete's prize vegetables.	9
13720	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	4	“Silly Sid!” growled Pete.	10
13721	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	8	“Now I’ll never win the best vegetable competition.	11
13722	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	6	Back to the kennels with you!”	12
13723	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	4	“I know,” thought Sid.	13
13724	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	9	“I’ll show everyone what a good singer I am.	14
13725	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	5	That will cheer them up.”	15
13726	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	13	He howled and howled as loud as his doggy lungs would let him.	16
13727	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	7	But… ... he woke the whole street!	17
13728	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	2	“SILLY SID!”	18
13729	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	6	they cried, throwing water at him-	19
13730	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	2	“Go away!”	20
13731	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	12	Poor Sid. Sad, wet and lonely he crept back to the kennels.	21
13732	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	5	“Nobody wants me,” he thought.	22
13733	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	6	“I’ll never find a proper home.”	23
13734	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	11	The next morning Sid was wakened by a very strange smell.	24
13735	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	41	He put his nose into the air and, without thinking, he followed the smell… out the window, across the yard, over the wall, under the fence, through the garden, around the bird table until at last he came to… A fire!	25
13736	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	6	Little Billy’s dinner was on fire.	26
13737	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	6	Grandma had forgotten all about it.	27
13738	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	11	Sid jumped up and down and he sang and he woofed.	28
13739	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	12	And he howled as loud as his doggy lungs would let him.	29
13740	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	2	Until… ...	30
13741	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	20	the firefighter came and, with a rush and a gush and a great big splash, he put the fire out!	31
13742	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	4	“Clever Sid,” said Grandma.	32
13743	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	5	“Brave Sid,” said the firefighter.	33
13744	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	5	“Super Sid,” said the crowd.	34
13745	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	5	“My Sid!” said Little Billy.	35
13746	Super Sid The Silly Sausage Dog	14	So Sid had found not one but two of the nicest kindest owners ever!	36
13747	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	15	Far from the busy bustle of town, Bear was ready for a nice, simple Christmas.	0
13748	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	13	His cosy fire popped and danced, and his candle cast a golden glow.	1
13749	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	12	But as he opened his favourite book, he heard a loud Toot!	2
13750	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	1	Toot!	3
13751	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	3	Bear looked up.	4
13752	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	4	“Whoever could that be?”	5
13753	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	6	“Hello!” said a cheery little frog.	6
13754	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	8	“I’ve arrived for my Christmas - - EXTRAVAGANZA!	7
13755	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	4	Show me the lights!	8
13756	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	2	The tree!	9
13757	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	3	The flying reindeer!	10
13758	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	4	Let’s get Christmas started!”	11
13759	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	7	Frog waved a brochure under Bear's nose.	12
13760	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	6	“The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel?” read Bear.	13
13761	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	7	“I think you’ve got the wrong place.”	14
13762	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	2	“No! No!”	15
13763	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	4	Frog tapped the map.	16
13764	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	4	“It’s right here, see?”	17
13765	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	3	Bear looked closer.	18
13766	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	1	“Oh!	19
13767	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	3	Your map’s upside-down.	20
13768	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	10	That hotel is on the other side of the world.”	21
13769	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	8	“But ... it CAN T be!” wailed Frog.	22
13770	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	12	“I had it all planned - I’ve even knitted a hat, look!	23
13771	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	11	Now I’ll never get to my hotel in time for Christmas!”	24
13772	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	4	Bear thought very hard.	25
13773	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	8	“You could always stay with . . .	26
13774	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	4	umm . . .	27
13775	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	1	me?”	28
13776	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	3	he said kindly.	29
13777	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	7	“I’m going to have a wonderful Christmas!”	30
13778	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	2	“You ARE?”	31
13779	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	5	Frog brushed his tears away.	32
13780	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	1	"""Hurrah!”"	33
13781	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	17	He hopped on in, drank a HUGE mug of cocoa, then dozed off by Bear’s cosy fire.	34
13782	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	11	"As Frog slept, Bear flicked through the brochure… ""A singing tree?”"	35
13783	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	2	he gasped.	36
13784	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	4	A supersonic sleigh ride?	37
13785	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	5	Frog won’t find that here!”	38
13786	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	14	But then he looked at the small snoring bundle dreaming of a magical Christmas.	39
13787	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	5	“Poor little fellow,” whispered Bear.	40
13788	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	6	Let’s see what we can do!”	41
13789	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	8	“Bear! Bear!” called Frog early the next morning.	42
13790	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	7	“Can we please start our Christmas EXTRAVAGANZA?”	43
13791	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	4	“Of course,” yawned Bear.	44
13792	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	8	So Frog checked the brochure . . .	45
13793	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	11	"“Ooo, so do you have an all-you-can-eat North Pole breakfast bar?"""	46
13794	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	4	“Not exactly, replied Bear.	47
13795	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	6	“But we could make iced pastries?”	48
13796	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	1	“Really??	49
13797	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	3	With Christmas sprinkles?	50
13798	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	2	Show me!	51
13799	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	2	Show me!!”	52
13800	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	2	Frog cried.	53
13801	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	10	Bear handed him an apron and they started to bake.	54
13802	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	12	And although it wasn’t exactly like the brochure, Frog rather liked it!	55
13803	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	7	With breakfast ticked off, Frog looked around.	56
13804	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	8	“Bear, where is your Christmas tree?” he asked.	57
13805	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	9	“My brochure has a BIG one - that sings!	58
13806	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	8	Smiling, Bear led Frog outside . . .	59
13807	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	4	“Will this one do?”	60
13808	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	2	he asked.	61
13809	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	6	Frog looked up . . .	62
13810	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	5	and up ... and UP!	63
13811	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	1	WOW!	64
13812	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	6	Bear’s beautiful tree twinkled with frost.	65
13813	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	12	“And look!” cried Frog as two little robins hopped about, chirping brightly.	66
13814	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	6	“It’s even got interactive singing decorations!	67
13815	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	4	And . . .	68
13816	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	1	SNOW!	69
13817	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	6	Do you have a snow- machine?”	70
13818	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	4	“No! No!” chuckled Bear.	71
13819	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	3	“That’s real snow!”	72
13820	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	7	Frog soon found he adored real snow.	73
13821	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	6	And long walks through the woods.	74
13822	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	3	And picnic lunches!	75
13823	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	6	In the snow Frog found footprints.	76
13824	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	5	“Let’s follow them…” smiled Bear.	77
13825	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	9	And there in the clearing were three real reindeer!	78
13826	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	7	“Now we can have a sleigh ride!!’	79
13827	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	2	whooped Frog.	80
13828	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	5	But Bear shook his head.	81
13829	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	7	“Sorry, these aren’t Santa’s reindeer,” he said.	82
13830	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	7	“And sadly I don’t have a sleigh.”	83
13831	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	12	But Bear knew exactly what Frog would like instead . . .	84
13832	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	2	“Snowball fight!	85
13833	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	3	Hurrah!!” cheered Frog.	86
13834	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	7	“And that’s not even in the brochure!”	87
13835	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	8	They played until the sky turned inky blue.	88
13836	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	6	“And now for the BEST bit!”	89
13837	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	2	Frog exclaimed.	90
13838	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	7	“Time to turn on the Christmas lights!”	91
13839	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	18	He whisked out his brochure and showed Bear a photo with string upon string of lights, flashing away.	92
13840	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	3	“Oh,” Bear sighed.	93
13841	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	6	His Christmas lights weren’t like those.	94
13842	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	9	Bear hurried home and lit all of His candles.	95
13843	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	4	“W-will these lights do?”	96
13844	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	2	he asked.	97
13845	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	2	Frog blinked.	98
13846	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	8	They weren’t quite the EXTRAVAGANZA he d expected.	99
13847	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	9	But Bear had been so kind . . .	100
13848	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	4	“Why . . .	101
13849	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	8	y-yesl” spluttered Frog, putting on a big smile.	102
13850	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	4	“So ... ummmm ...	103
13851	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	1	Christmassy!”	104
13852	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	7	They watched the golden flames in silence.	105
13853	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	6	Then suddenly Bear’s eyes lit up.	106
13854	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	3	“Follow me, Frog!”	107
13855	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	9	he said, grabbing hats and scarves . . .	108
13856	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	4	"“What about these lights?"""	109
13857	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	5	Bear pointed to the sky.	110
13858	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	4	“Oh, Bear!” gasped Frog.	111
13859	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	3	They were perfect!	112
13860	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	11	Back in the warm, the winter moon shone through Bear’s window.	113
13861	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	6	“What a magical day!” said Frog.	114
13862	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	8	And it wasn’t over yet . . .	115
13863	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	3	“Hush!” whispered Bear.	116
13864	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	3	“What’s that jingling?	117
13865	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	5	It’s coming from the rooftop.”	118
13866	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	10	Frog checked the brochure - not a THING about jingles!	119
13867	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	4	“It must be Santa!”	120
13868	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	2	Bear exclaimed.	121
13869	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	8	“But we need to be asleep - quick!”	122
13870	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	10	They dived under the blankets and shut their eyes tight.	123
13871	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	2	“Psst, Bear!	124
13872	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	3	Are you sleeping?	125
13873	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	2	I am!	126
13874	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	2	chattered Frog.	127
13875	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	8	But Bear was already snoring . . .	128
13876	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	10	They each took an end of the ribbon and pulled.	129
13877	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	4	“A sleigh! beamed Bear.	130
13878	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	9	“Why, Frog - this is Just what we need...”	131
13879	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	12	On Christmas morning, there was a beautifully wrapped present by the fire.	132
13880	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	3	“Bear!” squealed Frog.	133
13881	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	1	“Look!	134
13882	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	3	It’s from Santa!	135
13883	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	3	He came!” ...	136
13884	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	4	for our sleigh ride!”	137
13885	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	3	“SUPERSONIC!” cheered Frog.	138
13886	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	6	‘Can I stay again next year?	139
13887	The Christmas Extravaganza Hotel	6	Your Christmas Hotel is the BEST!”	140
13888	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	7	"""This simply won’t do,” said the King."	0
13889	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	4	“You’ll have to go.”	1
13890	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	13	He shook his head so hard that his crown toppled over one eye.	2
13891	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	9	But Cinder, the King’s Dragon, didn’t dare to smile.	3
13892	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	7	“What sort of dragon are you, anyway?”	4
13893	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	3	the King continued-	5
13894	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	21	“All the other kings have proper fire-breathing dragons while I, KING OF TARRAGONIA, have a dragon who can only blow... bubbles!	6
13895	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	4	It’s just too embarrassing.”	7
13896	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	6	The King was right, thought Cinder.	8
13897	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	5	He was a sad disappointment.	9
13898	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	13	Coming from a famous dragon family, great things had been expected of him.	10
13899	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	30	But when he became the junior dragon at the palace, he found he could only blow bubbles... ...and however hard he puffed and snorted, not one flicker of flame appeared.	11
13900	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	29	Instead, he blew streams of bubbles and the harder he snorted, the more bubbles appeared… until he was standing up to his scaly chest in one enormous bubble bath.	12
13901	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	5	All the children loved him.	13
13902	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	12	“Blow us some bubbles, Cinder,” they would shout whenever they saw him.	14
13903	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	14	They thought bubbles were much better than fire, but the King was not amused-	15
13904	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	7	Now he’d decided that Cinder must go-	16
13905	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	8	He’d even put an advertisement in the Times”.	17
13906	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	10	“Tarragonia It read: WANTED A fire-breathing dragon for palace duties.	18
13907	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	12	Applicants must be able to produce large quantities of smoke and fire.	19
13908	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	4	One dragon had applied.	20
13909	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	23	“When he comes this afternoon you may be present in the Throne Room to see how a real dragon behaves,” said the King.	21
13910	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	12	At two o’clock there was an enormous roaring at the palace gates.	22
13911	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	23	“Blaze, the World’s Most Fearsome Dragon, wishes to see the King,” bellowed an enormous voice and the air filled with smoke and flames.	23
13912	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	14	“OK, OK, show-off, keep your fireworks for the King,” snapped the palace sentry crossly.	24
13913	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	15	He was fond of Cinder and thought it was a shame he had to go.	25
13914	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	6	“Where is the King?” thundered Blaze.	26
13915	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	17	Then, without waiting to be announced, he stormed into the Throne Room where the King was seated.	27
13916	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	7	Cinder was crouching miserably in a corner.	28
13917	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	10	“I bring fire for your Majesty,” the enormous dragon roared.	29
13918	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	16	The King looked rather alarmed as the creature’s hot breath reached him and frizzled his beard.	30
13919	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	22	Then the carpet started smouldering and flames crept up the curtains When his crown began to melt the King had had enough.	31
13920	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	3	"""Stop” he ordered."	32
13921	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	6	“That will do nicely, thank you.”	33
13922	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	6	But Blaze, it seemed, couldn't stop.	34
13923	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	14	He was great at starting fires, he explained, but no use at stopping them.	35
13924	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	6	“Cinder, do something,” whimpered the King.	36
13925	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	9	Cinder did the only thing he could think of.	37
13926	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	30	He blew with all his might and, as the bubbles began to fill the room the flames died down, the carpet no longer smouldered, and the Royal Crown stopped melting.	38
13927	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	6	“Now I’ve done it,” thought Cinder.	39
13928	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	6	“I’ve quite put out Blaze’s fire.”	40
13929	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	12	Blaze himself was pretty put out too, but the King was delighted.	41
13930	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	19	“Thank goodness you were here, he said, as he ordered a dish of ice cream to cool himself down.	42
13931	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	26	“Some people don’t know what they want - even when they get it,” muttered Blaze huffily as he departed in a cloud of very black smoke.	43
13932	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	17	“I don’t hold with all this smoke pollution,” said the King as he gobbled his ice cream.	44
13933	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	5	“Now, let’s write another advertisement.”	45
13934	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	17	It appeared the next morning and read: BY ROYAL DECREE Breathing fire is now forbidden in Tarragonia.	46
13935	Cinder the Bubble-Blowing Dragon	21	Out-of- work Dragons wishing to train for the new Royal Bubble-Blowing Brigade, should write to: Sir Cinder, the Palace Fire Extinguisher.	47

13989	The Truth According to Arthur	5	And this is The Truth.	1
13990	The Truth According to Arthur	25	Arthur and The Truth are NOT the best of friends right now ... because today THIS happened, Which caused THIS ... and also THIS !	2
13991	The Truth According to Arthur	22	The Truth was, Arthur knew he’d done WRONG because his mum had told him he wasn’t to ride his brother’s BIG bike.	3
13992	The Truth According to Arthur	18	So when his friend Noah asked what had happened, Arthur tried BENDING The Truth just a little bit.	4
13993	The Truth According to Arthur	14	“This Supercool princess asked if she could have a go on my brother’s bike.	5
13994	The Truth According to Arthur	13	She’d never ridden one before ... ... and bashed into my mum’s car.	6
13995	The Truth According to Arthur	5	She didn’t even say “SORRY!”	7
13996	The Truth According to Arthur	1	“Uh-oh!	8
13997	The Truth According to Arthur	11	I bet your mum’s going to be REALLY cross,” said Noah.	9
13998	The Truth According to Arthur	8	That wasn’t EXACTLY what Arthur wanted to hear.	10
13999	The Truth According to Arthur	16	So when his friend Lula asked him what had happened, Arthur tried STRETCHING The Truth instead.	11
14000	The Truth According to Arthur	20	“I was just having a little go on my brother’s bike when an alien asked if he could borrow it.	12
14001	The Truth According to Arthur	15	He said he needed it to get home… I think he thought it would fly!”	13
14002	The Truth According to Arthur	1	“Uh-oh.	14
14003	The Truth According to Arthur	12	I bet your mum’s NOT going to be very pleased!” sighed Lula.	15
14004	The Truth According to Arthur	9	That wasn’t EXACTLY what Arthur wanted to hear either.	16
14005	The Truth According to Arthur	8	Arthur decided that more drastic action was needed.	17
14006	The Truth According to Arthur	7	He tried COVERING UP The Truth ...	18
14007	The Truth According to Arthur	2	DISGUISING it...	19
14008	The Truth According to Arthur	13	HIDING it... but it refused to stay covered up, or disguised, or hidden!	20
14009	The Truth According to Arthur	17	So when Little Frankie asked Arthur what had happened, Arthur decided just to IGNORE The Truth altogether.	21
14010	The Truth According to Arthur	7	“It has NOTHING to do with me.	22
14011	The Truth According to Arthur	14	My brother’s bike just transformed into a Giant Robot and Mum’s car did too.	23
14012	The Truth According to Arthur	11	There was a H UGE fight... … and Mum’s car won!”	24
14013	The Truth According to Arthur	4	“Cooool!” said Little Frankie.	25

14017	The Truth According to Arthur	3	It was Mum.	29
14018	The Truth According to Arthur	7	Time for Arthur to face The Truth.	30
14019	The Truth According to Arthur	8	He looked The Truth square in the eye.	31
14020	The Truth According to Arthur	4	The Truth looked back.	32
14021	The Truth According to Arthur	11	“Arthur, do you have something to tell me?” asked his mum.	33
14022	The Truth According to Arthur	4	What will Arthur do?	34
14023	The Truth According to Arthur	4	What would YOU do?	35
14024	The Truth According to Arthur	8	Well, Arthur said something that surprised even him.	36
14025	The Truth According to Arthur	3	“It was me!	37
14026	The Truth According to Arthur	3	I did it.	38
14027	The Truth According to Arthur	1	Sorry.”	39
14028	The Truth According to Arthur	9	And that turned out to be ALL RIGHT, actually.	40
14029	The Truth According to Arthur	21	Although Mum wasn’t too happy about her car and the bike, she was pleased that Arthur had told her The Truth.	41
14030	The Truth According to Arthur	16	So, what started out as a BAD day… finished up being a GOOD day for Arthur.	42

14103	Monkey Puzzle	7	None of these creatures looks like me!”	70
14104	Monkey Puzzle	8	“You never told me she looked like you!”	71
14105	Monkey Puzzle	4	“Of course I didn’t!	72
14106	Monkey Puzzle	4	I thought you knew!”	73
14107	Monkey Puzzle	3	“I didn’t know.	74
14108	Monkey Puzzle	2	I couldn’t!	75
14109	Monkey Puzzle	5	You see . . .	76
14110	Monkey Puzzle	5	O I “. . .	77
14111	Monkey Puzzle	7	None of my babies looks like me.	78
14112	Monkey Puzzle	5	So she looks like you!	79
14113	Monkey Puzzle	11	Well, if that’s the case We’ll soon discover her hiding place.”	80
14114	Monkey Puzzle	3	“No, no, no!	81
14115	Monkey Puzzle	3	That’s my dad!”	82
14116	Monkey Puzzle	6	“Come, little monkey, come, come, come.	83
14117	Monkey Puzzle	7	It’s time I took you home to….”	84
14118	Monkey Puzzle	1	“Mum!”	85
14119	Little Monkey	6	Monkey loved living in the jungle.	0
14120	Little Monkey	13	There were so many things to do and so many things to see.	1
14121	Little Monkey	5	But every now and then...	2
14122	Little Monkey	5	Things went a bit wrong.	3
14123	Little Monkey	1	“Ooof!”	4
14124	Little Monkey	5	Monkey had a little problem.	5
14125	Little Monkey	6	And the problem was being little.	6
14126	Little Monkey	7	Some days everything was out of reach.	7
14127	Little Monkey	7	Other days it was out of sight.	8
14128	Little Monkey	1	“Look!”	9
14129	Little Monkey	1	“Wow!”	10
14130	Little Monkey	5	Things were always too deep.	11
14131	Little Monkey	9	too dangerous and too difficult for someone so little.	12
14132	Little Monkey	6	“No, you can’t climb up here.”	13
14133	Little Monkey	8	Monkey was fed up with always missing out.	14
14134	Little Monkey	7	So one day she made a decision.	15
14135	Little Monkey	7	A very brave and very BIG decision.	16
14136	Little Monkey	10	“I will climb to the top of the tallest tree.	17
14137	Little Monkey	10	The jungle is NOT too big for me, you’ll see!”	18
14138	Little Monkey	5	It wasn’t an easy journey.	19
14139	Little Monkey	4	Not easy at all.	20
14140	Little Monkey	6	The river was deep and dangerous.	21
14141	Little Monkey	5	The path was often difficult.	22
14142	Little Monkey	14	But Monkey would not give up and, step by step, she found her way.	23
14143	Little Monkey	7	Everywhere Monkey looked she noticed little things.	24
14144	Little Monkey	7	And the little things did amazing things!	25
14145	Little Monkey	4	“Now it’s my turn.”	26
14146	Little Monkey	2	she said.	27
14147	Little Monkey	5	So Monkey began to count.	28
14148	Little Monkey	4	“ “One, two… threeeeeeeee!”	29
14149	Little Monkey	4	“Who’s too little now?	30
14150	Little Monkey	3	“ NOT ME.”	31
14151	Little Monkey	15	Soon Monkey I had reached the very bottom of the tallest tree in the jungle.	32
14152	Little Monkey	11	“This will be fun,” she said, and she began to climb.	33
14153	Little Monkey	12	Up she went, climbing higher, and higher …right to the very top.	34
14154	Little Monkey	9	The world below looked so little and so beautiful!	35
14155	Little Monkey	5	Finally Monkey could see EVERYTHING!	36
14156	Little Monkey	6	Including the rest of her troop.	37
14157	Little Monkey	7	“They look very excited to see me!”	38
14158	Little Monkey	22	It must be time to go, thought Monkey, and she swung down from the tallest tree, feeling very pleased and very proud.	39
14159	Little Monkey	12	Monkey did love living in the jungle, now more than ever before.	40
14160	Little Monkey	10	“I may be small but I’m very brave,” she said.	41
14161	Little Monkey	9	“And very lucky!” said the rest of the troop.	42
14162	Little Monkey	6	Little Monkey knew they were right.	43
14163	Little Monkey	11	Because the smaller you are, the larger your adventures can be.	44
14164	Little Monkey	7	But best of all . . .	45
14165	Little Monkey	5	the bigger the hugs feel.	46
